5,"Hi, it's my first post here, I'm new in this community. So... I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for at least 8 years now. Today is my 25th birthday. Things have been extremely bad lately. I lost my job that I adored and I feel useless because of unemployment, I live in a country where unemployment rates are extremely high and my field of work doesn't have many opportunities. Even outside of it, it's hard to find work. I feel hopeless and it has made my suicidal thoughts much worse.

I actually plan to do it tonight. I had a shitty birthday and I really don't need to live a day more. Leading up to today, I've broken up with my girlfriend and pushed my family members away from me as much as possible, so it will lessen their pain. It hurts a lot, but it's for their own good.

I've tried therapy and medication, it helped briefly but my psychiatrist told me that my depression will keep coming back easily, I have family history of depression and suicide so it's no wonder. I can't keep going through this and bringing down my loved ones. I can't keep living like this.

I guess the reason I made this post is to vent. I don't know if I'm actually going to go through it tonight. I hope I'll be able to. My feelings have gone numb and I just want to close my eyes forever. I called a suicide hotline and the operator tried to guilt me into staying alive by telling me all about how my family will miss me... I know they will, but it will pass with time. I'm very worried about them, but I can't keep living for them. It's been the only reason I've kept living all these years... I can't do this anymore.

So, tonight might be the end. Sorry for venting. I'm keeping it a secret, obviously, but I felt like I had to tell someone, even anonymously on reddit.

7,"I assume the person cutting is a girl but i’m not sure. I was scrolling through random hashtags about adhd because i have it. Then in a post i clicked a self harming hashtag. Then I saw her profile with 2 or 3 posts of her cutting herself. Very new, and its been 6 days since she’s first made the profile.

First attempt talking:
Titles herself as an unwanted person. She wants help, and I saw it and I fucking had to do something. I couldn’t just leave someone crying for heIp. I’ve tried to talk to her using knowledge I’ve read online. She doesn’t want to talk to me and replies with “idk” constantly. So i said I’ll leave her and told her to think about seeking a professional. Told her to remember it’ll pass and some other things. So i stopped talking for 2 days.

Second attempt:
I came back to her profile account, and saw her new posts. She was trying to talk to me through her captions accompanied by photos with more cuts. She said “if you can’t help me no one can” and “help”. 

So i messaged her/him again asking if she thought about seeking professional help yet. She wrote “about?” and “ty” and asked how old i was. She then posted on her profile page again with “i need you but you don’t seem to need me 🙃🔫” with more fucking cuts...probably because it took me a while to respond since i didn’t see it. 
Back to the private messages. I said i was 19. She’s seen my message and hasn’t responded for about 4 hours now.

49,"I’ve been fighting a war that I can’t win. Depression, suicide attempts, alcoholism, and compulsive gambling. I took a really hard look in the mirror and realized my time here is coming in an end. No one can talk me out of it this time. My first attempt was a little over two years ago (thanks to my partner at the time screaming “fucking kill yourself”) and I’m so tired of the pain and loss.

The pain of having a long term partner cheat. The pain of my best friend overdosing. The pain of losing all trust in myself. I can’t go without a day about thinking about dying.

Once I made the plans and wrote out what I need to do before I go (write letters, clean, make amendments, etc.) I finally felt peace. There’s a tremendous amount of happiness surrounding the idea that I won’t be here much longer. Happy tears. It’s a permanent solution to a permanent problem.

The addict inside me needs to be stopped. The suicide hotline hung up on me. My regular therapist that I’ve been seeing for two years is quitting his practice. My dreams have been crushed. I’m in debt. This is the final chapter- I’m done. I’ve fought too long and it’s time to give up.

I don’t want to be 25 and already have more relapses than I can count. I’m done failing. I’m done disappointing others. I’m done causing conflicts that could be easily avoidable if I was simply not me. I love everything and everyone, but I truly hate what’s in the mirror. My mind is constantly persuaded by guilt and hate. The things I do are singular, detached from anything and everyone. There’s no origin. No one’s fault but my own. Remember that.

I have my next therapy appointment in 4 weeks but I don’t know how I’m gonna make it that long. I hate everything about myself. So if I can’t even love myself why should anyone else.

Remember, this too shall pass. You'll get through the hardest days you didn't know you could recover from. **And if all you ever did today was hold yourself together, then I'm proud of you.** You should be, too.

He has also told me that he has not told his parents about his depression out of fear of them worrying. He has also mentioned how his depression isn't even that big (even if it is very clear that it is) and that he wouldn't want to take the spot of someone who needs it more.

We're in the middle of a damn pandemic and my mom is in the category of high risk for covid. 

Before anyone asks our landlord waited until our states restrictions on evictions was lifted (which was on the first) before hitting us with the eviction notice. 

After I went through the rapid wave if emotions, crying my eyes out and just laying in bed for several hours straight, my brain just emotionally shut down. For the last few years I've been just chugging along, clinging to hope that things will at least stay stable and I could focus on my goals of being an artist. But now I feel nothing. I spent time with bf and I just faked a smile to seem fine but I just couldn't bring myself to find happiness which I know isn't fair to him.
Mom and I have been through a lot of shit and have scrapped by by the skin of our teeth but I just don't see how we can possibly pull through this. 

I've been contemplating swallowing all of my pills, taking enough meletonin to put myself to sleep and hope I just go in my sleep. I know the chances of success are slim but better then my other plan which is stop drinking and eating or to just yeet myself off the overpass. 

Am I selfish and a coward for wanting to die, yes but I'm just tired of fighting against the world only to get pushed down and spit on. I know mom will be devastated as will my friends and other loved ones (mom especially since my older sister passed away a couple years ago) but hopefully they'll understand that I'm weak and just can't keep going anymore just to be a burden on them.

Also been using a lot of coping skills and distraction to try and take my mind of suicide.

I had nothing to lose, I took big risks and fought like hell.  

I’m on medications now that I swore I’d never take, and guess what?   My depression appears to be treatment resistant.  

The gave me adderall and it keeps me awake - I plotted out all the things I’d have to do to get my life back on track and it’s more than I can get done in the next few months. 

That’s not even counting work (which I have to do), free time, things I wanted to accomplish, etc.

Anyway, I’m convinced it’s hopeless.  There appears to be no reasonable escape. 

In the next two months I can go get TMS, I can get EMDR, I can stay on my medications, but after all that then what?

My job environment sucks, my dream career has been derailed, the girl I loved left and I don’t want anything else.  I don’t even want to get better.  My therapist struggled to be polite when I said I didn’t want to be happy.  How am I going to achieve anything in therapy if there’s nothing I want to improve?

I liked who I was, I liked how strong and smart I became dealing with impossible situations.   But I’m miserable.  Nothing will remove the lifetime of bad experiences I’ve had.

Anyway, it’s like I’ve had greater things things and opportunities than I’ll have again in my lifetime.  For sure.  And I’m not sure I’d keep fighting for anything anymore.  I miss the girl who left me.  Period.  As I get older I realize there are fewer and fewer people I’d like to spend my time with.  And if my seemingly great relationship with her ended, then either I’m a fool or a loser.

I just really have nothing to look forward to.  I have tried so much already.   I don’t want to change myself bc myself has been forged through crucibles of trauma and I like who I became.  I like myself.  But I am miserable.  I am done with it.  It’s clear to me I don’t have enough control over things.  I don’t have enough energy.  My health is failing.  Everyone has left me.

I'm not even looking for help. I can't imagine what anybody could do and I never get responses from anybody, anywhere.

Lately I’ve started getting deep into this fantasy of inciting my own murder. I imagine how I would find someone to do it, what they would look like, how they would do it, etc. Like today I’ve been thinking about a timeline where I post on reddit somewhere inciting for someone to kill me. They contact me and I tell them that I want to be shot point blank from behind while I’m walking somewhere. We pick the date and the location and discuss what to do with my body. I’ve been constantly thinking about a way I can escape all this pain I’m in all the time and it’s gotten to the point where the thought of someone murdering me is more comforting than the thought of having to live any longer. I feel like everything in my life is telling me that I should die. I’m considering going to this bridge that goes over the river in my city, it’s very high up. I want to just sit on the edge at the top of it and look at the water and feel how high up I am. The thought of that is also comforting. If I felt like it I could just jump off and it would all be over. If I got drunk and went up there I know I would do it. I have no doubt. I guess I’m just conflicted. I’m still trying to hold onto hope but I don’t think I can ever really get better. I feel like my issues are too ingrained and there’s too many.

TLDR: anyone else fantasize about getting murdered??",suicide,"okay so to preface this is in no way sexual, its purely just a form of escapism that has developed for me the last few days or so im posting this wondering if anyone else can relate to this lately ive started getting deep into this fantasy of inciting my own murder i imagine how i would find someone to do it, what they would look like, how they would do it, etc like today ive been thinking about a timeline where i post on reddit somewhere inciting for someone to kill me they contact me and i tell them that i want to be shot point blank from behind while im walking somewhere we pick the date and the location and discuss what to do with my body ive been constantly thinking about a way i can escape all this pain im in all the time and its gotten to the point where the thought of someone murdering me is more comforting than the thought of having to live any longer i feel like everything in my life is telling me that i should die im considering going to this bridge that goes over the river in my city, its very high up i want to just sit on the edge at the top of it and look at the water and feel how high up i am the thought of that is also comforting if i felt like it i could just jump off and it would all be over if i got drunk and went up there i know i would do it i have no doubt i guess im just conflicted im still trying to hold onto hope but i dont think i can ever really get better i feel like my issues are too ingrained and theres too many even if i could fix them do i have it in me to work that hard for that long? i hate myself so deeply i dont even think i deserve to feel better if im honest i dont know what im talking about anymore this post went on a complete tangent tldr anyone else fantasize about getting murdered??",1,2046,"[101, 3100, 2061, 2000, 18443, 2023, 2003, 1999, 2053, 2126, 4424, 1010, 2049, 11850, 2074, 1037, 2433, 1997, 9686, 17695, 2964, 2008, 2038, 2764, 2005, 2033, 1996, 2197, 2261, 2420, 2030, 2061, 10047, 14739, 2023, 6603, 2065, 3087, 2842, 2064, 14396, 2000, 2023, 9906, 4921, 2063, 2318, 2893, 2784, 2046, 2023, 5913, 1997, 4297, 15402, 2026, 2219, 4028, 1045, 5674, 2129, 1045, 2052, 2424, 2619, 2000, 2079, 2009, 1010, 2054, 2027, 2052, 2298, 2066, 1010, 2129, 2027, 2052, 2079, 2009, 1010, 4385, 2066, 2651, 4921, 2063, 2042, 3241, 2055, 1037, 17060, 2073, 1045, 2695, 2006, 2417, 23194, 4873, 4297, 15402, 2005, 2619, 2000, 3102, 2033, 2027, 3967, 2033, 1998, 1045, 2425, 2068, 2008, 1045, 2215, 2000, 2022, 2915, 2391, 8744, 2013, 2369, 2096, 10047, 3788, 4873, 2057, 4060, 1996, 3058, 1998, 1996, 3295, 1998, 6848, 2054, 2000, 2079, 2007, 2026, 2303, 4921, 2063, 2042, 7887, 3241, 2055, 1037, 2126, 1045, 2064, 4019, 2035, 2023, 3255, 10047, 1999, 2035, 1996, 2051, 1998, 2049, 5407, 2000, 1996, 2391, 2073, 1996, 2245, 1997, 2619, 21054, 2033, 2003, 2062, 16334, 2084, 1996, 2245, 1997, 2383, 2000, 2444, 2151, 2936, 1045, 2514, 2066, 2673, 1999, 2026, 2166, 2003, 4129, 2033, 2008, 1045, 2323, 3280, 10047, 6195, 2183, 2000, 2023, 2958, 2008, 3632, 2058, 1996, 2314, 1999, 2026, 2103, 1010, 2049, 2200, 2152, 2039, 1045, 2215, 2000, 2074, 4133, 2006, 1996, 3341, 2012, 1996, 2327, 1997, 2009, 1998, 2298, 2012, 1996, 2300, 1998, 2514, 2129, 2152, 2039, 1045, 2572, 1996, 2245, 1997, 2008, 2003, 2036, 16334, 2065, 1045, 2371, 2066, 2009, 1045, 2071, 2074, 5376, 2125, 1998, 2009, 2052, 2035, 2022, 2058, 2065, 1045, 2288, 7144, 1998, 2253, 2039, 2045, 1045, 2113, 1045, 2052, 2079, 2009, 1045, 2031, 2053, 4797, 1045, 3984, 10047, 2074, 4736, 2098, 10047, 2145, 2667, 2000, 2907, 3031, 3246, 2021, 1045, 2123, 2102, 2228, 1045, 2064, 2412, 2428, 2131, 2488, 1045, 2514, 2066, 2026, 3314, 2024, 2205, 13749, 27361, 1998, 2045, 2015, 2205, 2116, 2130, 2065, 1045, 2071, 8081, 2068, 2079, 1045, 2031, 2009, 1999, 2033, 2000, 2147, 2008, 2524, 2005, 2008, 2146, 1029, 1045, 5223, 2870, 2061, 6171, 1045, 2123, 2102, 2130, 2228, 1045, 10107, 2000, 2514, 2488, 2065, 10047, 7481, 1045, 2123, 2102, 2113, 2054, 10047, 3331, 2055, 4902, 2023, 2695, 2253, 2006, 1037, 3143, 27250, 1056, 6392, 2099, 3087, 2842, 5470, 10230, 4697, 2055, 2893, 7129, 1029, 1029, 102]",390,0,1

118,"I keep looking back on my life, and I can't help but feel like the universe is trying to kill me.

Literally from the moment I was born, I had a breathing issue that had to be dealt with. Less than a year later, I got a very bad case of the flu and had to get hospitalized. A few years ago, I slipped on something (still no idea what the fuck it was), hit my head, and could've bled out if the doctor hadn't hurried the fuck up.

I'm also being driven to suicide by bullshit that's not my fault. I'm bisexual, so of course both of my parents seem to be biphobic. I've been to four different schools, two of which have consisted of mostly bullies and homophobes. At one of my schools, even the teachers hated me even though I was a well behaved student. It also doesn't help that I'm autistic, so going through all of this shit while only being able to keep one friend is tough.

On the topic of my one friend, for literally no reason, I've just lost all interest in talking to him. I like him and he's really nice, I just lost interest for no reason. Then that makes me feel lonely, and I feel horrible for not wanting to talk to him, which makes me even more depressed and even closer to suicide.

There are only two things that have stopped me from suicide. One is my cat, one of the few beings on this planet who actually fucking cares about me. The other is just a lack of planning. I don't know how I would even do it.

If the universe is out to kill me, can it please hurry? I want to fall asleep tonight and never wake up. That would literally be the best thing to ever happen to me. If I died tonight, my one friend and my cat would be upset. Everyone else would get over it within 2 weeks I feel like.",suicide,"i keep looking back on my life, and i can t help but feel like the universe is trying to kill me literally from the moment i was born, i had a breathing issue that had to be dealt with less than a year later, i got a very bad case of the flu and had to get hospitalized a few years ago, i slipped on something still no idea what the fuck it was , hit my head, and could ve bled out if the doctor hadn t hurried the fuck up i m also being driven to suicide by bullshit that s not my fault i m bisexual, so of course both of my parents seem to be biphobic i ve been to four different schools, two of which have consisted of mostly bullies and homophobes at one of my schools, even the teachers hated me even though i was a well behaved student it also doesn t help that i m autistic, so going through all of this shit while only being able to keep one friend is tough on the topic of my one friend, for literally no reason, i ve just lost all interest in talking to him i like him and he s really nice, i just lost interest for no reason then that makes me feel lonely, and i feel horrible for not wanting to talk to him, which makes me even more depressed and even closer to suicide there are only two things that have stopped me from suicide one is my cat, one of the few beings on this planet who actually fucking cares about me the other is just a lack of planning i don t know how i would even do it if the universe is out to kill me, can it please hurry? i want to fall asleep tonight and never wake up that would literally be the best thing to ever happen to me if i died tonight, my one friend and my cat would be upset everyone else would get over it within 2 weeks i feel like ",1,2046,"[101, 1045, 2562, 2559, 2067, 2006, 2026, 2166, 1010, 1998, 1045, 2064, 1056, 2393, 2021, 2514, 2066, 1996, 5304, 2003, 2667, 2000, 3102, 2033, 6719, 2013, 1996, 2617, 1045, 2001, 2141, 1010, 1045, 2018, 1037, 5505, 3277, 2008, 2018, 2000, 2022, 9411, 2007, 2625, 2084, 1037, 2095, 2101, 1010, 1045, 2288, 1037, 2200, 2919, 2553, 1997, 1996, 19857, 1998, 2018, 2000, 2131, 24735, 1037, 2261, 2086, 3283, 1010, 1045, 5707, 2006, 2242, 2145, 2053, 2801, 2054, 1996, 6616, 2009, 2001, 1010, 2718, 2026, 2132, 1010, 1998, 2071, 2310, 23919, 2041, 2065, 1996, 3460, 2910, 1056, 9520, 1996, 6616, 2039, 1045, 1049, 2036, 2108, 5533, 2000, 5920, 2011, 14636, 2008, 1055, 2025, 2026, 6346, 1045, 1049, 22437, 1010, 2061, 1997, 2607, 2119, 1997, 2026, 3008, 4025, 2000, 2022, 12170, 20200, 1045, 2310, 2042, 2000, 2176, 2367, 2816, 1010, 2048, 1997, 2029, 2031, 5031, 1997, 3262, 7087, 3111, 1998, 24004, 8458, 20891, 2015, 2012, 2028, 1997, 2026, 2816, 1010, 2130, 1996, 5089, 6283, 2033, 2130, 2295, 1045, 2001, 1037, 2092, 26979, 3076, 2009, 2036, 2987, 1056, 2393, 2008, 1045, 1049, 8740, 16774, 2594, 1010, 2061, 2183, 2083, 2035, 1997, 2023, 4485, 2096, 2069, 2108, 2583, 2000, 2562, 2028, 2767, 2003, 7823, 2006, 1996, 8476, 1997, 2026, 2028, 2767, 1010, 2005, 6719, 2053, 3114, 1010, 1045, 2310, 2074, 2439, 2035, 3037, 1999, 3331, 2000, 2032, 1045, 2066, 2032, 1998, 2002, 1055, 2428, 3835, 1010, 1045, 2074, 2439, 3037, 2005, 2053, 3114, 2059, 2008, 3084, 2033, 2514, 9479, 1010, 1998, 1045, 2514, 9202, 2005, 2025, 5782, 2000, 2831, 2000, 2032, 1010, 2029, 3084, 2033, 2130, 2062, 14777, 1998, 2130, 3553, 2000, 5920, 2045, 2024, 2069, 2048, 2477, 2008, 2031, 3030, 2033, 2013, 5920, 2028, 2003, 2026, 4937, 1010, 2028, 1997, 1996, 2261, 9552, 2006, 2023, 4774, 2040, 2941, 8239, 14977, 2055, 2033, 1996, 2060, 2003, 2074, 1037, 3768, 1997, 4041, 1045, 2123, 1056, 2113, 2129, 1045, 2052, 2130, 2079, 2009, 2065, 1996, 5304, 2003, 2041, 2000, 3102, 2033, 1010, 2064, 2009, 3531, 9241, 1029, 1045, 2215, 2000, 2991, 6680, 3892, 1998, 2196, 5256, 2039, 2008, 2052, 6719, 2022, 1996, 2190, 2518, 2000, 2412, 4148, 2000, 2033, 2065, 1045, 2351, 3892, 1010, 2026, 2028, 2767, 1998, 2026, 4937, 2052, 2022, 6314, 3071, 2842, 2052, 2131, 2058, 2009, 2306, 1016, 3134, 1045, 2514, 2066, 102]",379,0,1

I did do one year of college for hospitality management 

Likewise. Things did not get better for me since then

I am still both socially awkward, isolated and depressed.
I am bored of life. helpless.❤ I have no friends, in which whom I can't relate to. 

I live for what I like and love to eat. I barely have any hobbies besides cooking, singing, and drawing a little and watching YouTube. 

My parents are very little when it comes to acknowledging my future. 

Would it be wrong to kill myself even tho I got nothing going on for life? I am used to being depressed, Even though I am a stronger person for who I was before


Big point here. I won't kill myself because of that.

170,"I am done and want to end it. Of course I have a lot of debt from a credit card and with parents. Goal is to make sure family is safe from retaliation from law enforcement and debt collectors. 

Living in California

I would like to liquidate my assets (car and cheap/old apartment furnishings) to give to parents tax free to off set damages. Cash, bond, ira savings, trust fund? Best way to maximize approximately $15,000 for family?

How can I protect family against retaliation from credit card company? I am the only signer on one credit card and a cosigner with mother to one with a different credit card company and bank. 

Can Law Enforcement retaliate against family or investigate/tax/seize liquidated assets?

I am a cosigner for an apartment with my father until middle of next year, what's the best way to shield family from leasing agency retaliation?

It's safe to assume that committing suicide on private property is a huge headache for business owners. However the most effective way I can see to guarantee death would be to rent a gun from range and leave the body in an easily sanitized area.  Goal is to go quietly and efficiently with as little concern from others as possible and as cheaply as possible. Would a gun range have liability immunity in this case?

Finally I want to guarantee the body be recycled/donated and no memorial/funeral service is conducted. Do I need a lawyer to be executor of this or can I simply get a notary or cheaper/simpler alternative?

It all has gone nowhere and I just feel like no matter how the deck is shuffled, suicide is the inevitable end game here. I'm tired.

Suicide is easy.

Suicide is selfish.

But that in and of itself does not allow me to keep living. 

It's equally selfish to make them my reason to live. That implies that whenever I get hurt me it's their fault for forcing me to be alive. Eventually I'll come to hate them for forcing me to endure the pain of being alive. Sometimes I already do.

I can't die because of them, but I also can't live a life I hate just because of them.

221,I’m trapped in a vicious circle that never seems to stop. Nothing has gone my way for two years. I’m a recovering addict. 125 days clean off meth and proud of that but I can’t ever get my daughter back. My ex husbands family is very wealthy and will pay any amount to make sure I don’t get her. I love my boyfriend and his kids so much but what I give is never enough. I’m not enough for them. I don’t wanna hear about the whole life is worth living. What is worth all this pain. Haven’t I suffered enough? I want nothing but to just be happy and I’m a social anxiety nightmare everywhere I go. I feel like everyone is driving me to kill myself and I’m too scared to do it. All I wish every night is that I can fall asleep and never wake up. Only then will I truly be at peace. There is no more peace for me here on earth.

i live with my dad who can be so abusive to me but i cant move in with my mother because I used to live with her and she was also equally abusive in different ways. 

i do health and social care studies (im 27 i left it so late in life and i hate myself) One guy i met asked me why im doing studies still at 27 and I told him because I left it too late and I wanted to do it now his response was ""why are you stupid or something?"" Im so embarrassed i wish i never did this my life is ruined its too late to start a new or even try

I'm too old to be studying I hate my life I wanted to be a therapist it will never happen

 and i have been offered a job from my best and only friend to do personal care in a care home for a few hours a week. I do not want to do personal care I never have. I got into health and social to try to become a therapist but now I think I wasted so many years on the wrong course. My best friend said please dont let her down because its her name attached to this and they have given me opportunities that are hard to come by in this day and age.

with all the abuse at home and now this i see no other way out it was already ahrd enough

and now i am about to let my best friend down she will never forgive me or trust me again

i cant see any other way out 

i already felt like this for a long time because even my therapists were struggling to help me because of my home situations and I'm an adult so they can't help in the same way they would someone who is a child or a teenager.

also i dont want my family to get into trouble so i refuse to report them 

My dad wants to keep me a prisoner forever

and i cant return to my other family

i am trapped in this life

the one person i had is my best friend btu now i feel trapped by the job

i have nothing left

241,"Why is everyone else here? How do you guys hold on? I feel like I'm going to give up any day now, with no real plan beyond some kind of cathartic ending that leaves everyone with very little closure or comfort. I finally convinced my doctors to take me off all my medication in March, something I was in fact very proud about. I was actually feeling really great, right up until I tried to kill myself on April 17th.

Every day since then has been anxiety attacks and violent thoughts towards myself, with an underlying inability to cope with even the smallest inconveniences. It's important to mention that I don't think of my suicide attempt as a mistake, just a failure. Had there been any success I wouldn't be whining to you guys now. It's simply the misery of knowing I'm still alive when I have no reason to live that really kills me. The one thing that haunted me the worst after I survived, wasn't a memory or effect, or anything I had felt; I just couldn't stop wondering why I am still alive.

It's been 77 days since I tried, and every day I've wanted to try again. I finally gave in and decided to talk to my doctor about medications, because the anxiety attacks that have followed my suicide attempt have made living basically unbearable. What once was a mildly off putting occasional gift, became a consistent plight on regular life, and somehow I still can't help but feel like I'm giving up. I was so proud of getting off medication and now that I feel myself about to have to go on them again I feel like I'm moving backwards. All this progress for nothing, and all that.

Then again it's the apathy that really hits me the hardest. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to talk to people anymore, I don't want to watch movies anymore. I don't want to play video games anymore, or work out, or research, or anything else I'd loved so much.

The only place I can go is to the hospital where they will take away my shoelaces and everything else treat me like a 5 year old and probably drive me insane. It seems like a lot less work not to bother with living anymore, why does the world need me its already extremely overpopulated. I don't want to deal with our fucked up society anymore, or the idea of going to some outrageously expensive college even though my high school gives college level courses for free.

The only fights we've had is because she listens to her grandparents and she lets her emotions get the best of her and this time it wasn't a misunderstanding, she accused me of not caring when she ignored me knowing I was in pain for two days and yet she never fills me in on anything doesn't talk to me or give any real effort.

I watched all Dr K and Reckful videos about his depression and they gave me a lot of hope. He seemed fine in his latest videos, and said he was genuinely happy after lunching his game. Got the news of his suicide on 7am, just 1 hour and a half before my driving license exam, which I worked so hard to pass, and failed because I was so out of it. As they say, suicide is contagious and I'm making a big effort to not fuck it up.

I've been depressed for almost 2 years now and when I was close to taking the fast exist I went to the doctor because that seemed like the only other solution to the problem. (This was on February)
The doctor gave me an appointment with a psych 3 months later, so I waited patiently with that date in my mind to remain strong. Then corona happened and it was delayed another 3 more months, being the new date the 7th of July. Some relatives have talked very recently about their medical appointments being cancelled because of little corona infections happening again and I'm so terrified. I'm to o scared to call and ask if it has been canceled. I don't think I can do this until September alone.
I also have the university entrance exam on 6th of July (2 days left) and I haven't even started to study because I simply can't do it so I have probably already ruined my future.

There is one thing I've always cared about though, weakness, and one day I took a look at myself and I realised that for multiple reasons even aside from my depression I was pathetically weak and I hated it.

297,"I have considered suicide for a long time now, but this week was the limit.

This week my teacher told me I wasn’t going to graduate. As the only one of my class I had to stay at home and it hurt me so much when I saw pictures being shared on social media. They all seemed so happy and I was at home crying about what a failure I am. I seriously can’t do another year in school because it will mentally break me. I’d rather die than go to that school for another year. 

In the graduation pictures I saw A (I don’t want to use her name), a girl i’ve been in love with for 2 years, but off course she doesn’t love me. Why would she? How can she love me if I can’t even love myself? We were so good friends but I ruined everything when I told her how I felt. I blame myself so much for ruining everything. The worst thing is that I feel so comforted by her, that now when I need it the most I can’t turn to her anymore.

329," Since 2018 my dad and my mom have been fighting over him marrying another woman behind his back and this has caused a severe ripple in our family. They've been fighting back and fourth and my dad refused to do anything about the relationship between him, my mom, and the other woman. They've been on and off again with fights and arguments but things didn't really get bad until this year. After my dad revealed he was going to pay for another apartment for my mom to live in so he could separate himself and his family away from my mother, she flew into a frenzy throwing slurs at him until he ended up pushing my mother and yelling at me and my two sisters that if she says anything to divide us he will leave us and never come back. This all happened at the time of me making this post and idk what to do.

341,"My wife and I just got married. She came from the Philippines for the sole purpose of marrying me.

Got married in January. Been questioning a lot since then. Including my will to live.

We have been fighting more and more. She expresses how badly she wish she could go back to the Philippines. 

I want her to go. I don't want her to be bogged down here because of me. And divorce is unheard of in her family. 

She doesn't want to leave me though. 

So as a just in case basis I wrote down my suicide note on my phone. Should I need to then I will do a quick copy-paste and then blast my noggin off. Thats the plan as of this moment.

I’ve done this before but back then I was only getting a months supply at a time and I ended up sending out messages to my family and wound up in the er. This time however I just drank until I fell asleep. I did this on impulse, I wasn’t planning it up until like 1 or 2 hours before I did it. 

Well I woke up around 6 am shaking in a cold sweat. I could hardly walk but I made it to the bathroom to puke my guts out. It was a rough day but I managed to call in sick work (which I never do) and convince my wife that it was just alcohol withdrawal.
Anyway I looked up the half-life and it’s 12 hours. It’s been close to 48 hours and I’m still here. I don’t feel suicidal anymore but I don’t want this to happen again because it’ll just keep escalating until it works. Seeing a therapist has never helped me.

I have ran away from home like twice after heated arguments and got into cars of random dudes in hopes they take me somewhere and kill me but they were just dudes looking for fucks and I was highly disappointed.

Right now I’m in the middle though, I just got a new job so I’m finally able to feel like I’m worth something but I just keep worrying about the worst like I’m going to get fired or something. The other day while I was working someone really sketchy walked in and for a second I was actually scared. Then just 5 seconds later my brain took a tole to who cares if I die. If I get shot and die it’s whatever. Just a very passive suicide kind of mindset. I don’t want to get into the problems of my life but today has been a terrible day and today just seems like a good day to say fuck it. I guess in the end I just feel like I’m walking on thin ice and like at any moment I’ll be some bum on the streets all alone. I feel like I have no backup and like if I ever fell no one would be there to back me up. I kinda feel alone. I’m not alone, but I feel alone. Life is a series of random events, but I feel like the bad out weighs the good. I’m just tired of stressing out and worrying. The sad part is I’m only 18 so I know there’s plenty more of that coming my way. I just feel trapped and doomed to fail.

385,"I have been thinking about suicide alot again. I have been suicidal before in my teens because of depression, social anxiety, and i got bullied alot. Now i'm 20 and have been out of school for 2 years and i work now. I felt alot better not having to go to school anymore. Because of my 0 social skills i decided to become a trucker and i enjoyed it at first. But now i'm extremely lonely. I have no friends and I always work alone. When i get home from work i just sit in my room browsing reddit and watching youtube (even in the weekends). I'm just in this cycle of working alone -> going home sitting alone in my room -> work  -> home .... I don't do anything and i feel like a slave just working and then going to his cell. I am feeling very suicidal again and i decided that i don't want to go down that path again. So i quit my job, my last day is 31/7. I have no idea what i'm going to do after. I'm just lost. I also needed a hobby, something to do. So i bought a [Paramotor](https://www.vliegles.nl/images/thumbnails/product_image-2348-1500x844.jpg), I have been wanting to fly for a long time but never did it because it is expensive. Now i just said fuck it and spend like all my money on it. Parents think i'm crazy but whatever. I hope i can figure out how to be happy. But if i don't a paramotor is a nice way to commit suicide.

Like i said, I wasn't social, so what was the problem? my theory is a lot of shit happening in two weeks that pushed me over the edge. My father isn't the nicest, not abusve, physically, but mentally. I didn't have high esteem to born with, I was never told to be proud of what i've done so i wasn't. My dad and my mom got divorced on Christmas, they thought it was a good idea to tell me, my brother, and my sister (both younger than me) after opening out presents and i was 13 thinking, ""why wouldn't they tell me first?"" but my mom said it was for the best. The next thing was two weeks after Covid was my grandpa died when his heart went out. it didn't really hit me until a week later, when i started cutting.

424,"a month ago, I had a plan to kill myself. I went to the local crisis center instead. the people there were kind and all, but they didn't take me seriously.

the counselor I spoke to told me he doesn't think I'm depressed and kept telling me that killing myself would be stupid because it wouldn't solve anything. which I know is technically true, but it felt so dismissive. like he thought I was stupid for feeling the way I did.

we set up a time for him to call the next day and check in, but he said he wouldn't be concerned if I didn't answer. that hurt. I felt like he didn't believe my situation was serious. that or he just didn't care.

before I left, he asked if I still wanted to kill myself. I told him yes. and he just sent me on my way.

he called the next day, and we set up a time for one last check in the following day. but no one ever called. and honestly, that hurt. I'd had a really bad night and was counting on that call. which I guess was stupid on my part. I know it was a free service and I shouldn't complain. I just feel so hurt.

it took everything I had to ask for help. I had never asked for help before. and they wouldn't help me. because I guess I'm not ""sick"" enough. I go to work every day and I take care of my responsibilities and that means I can't really be depressed or in crisis or deserving of help.

I have attempted suicide about 6 times in the past 10 years. Two got me in the hospital and then a psych ward. Since I was a teenager, I’ve felt the ‘Call of the Void’. I’ve been self harming near consistently for over 10 years. I also became a drug addict and alcoholic. I was very deep into it for about 4 years. I am just over 1 year sober now. I didn’t care when I got my 1 year date. I don’t care about anything. I have royally fucked myself in my schooling program. I am so ashamed by that, that I asked around to see if anyone had a gun for sale. One did. I was going to exchange all my benzodiazepines and adderall for it. 

I only didn’t because of my girlfriend. In a way I hate her. She’s the only reason I’m still here. Her mom is in the hospital on a respirator for COVID. And her social circle is having major issues. But I also I truly love her. Like, she’s the one.

Her health is really bad and going downhill everyday and the day she dies i don't think i'll be able to live for myself. I've been using drugs for a long time to cope and for some sort of happiness and fulfilment, but now i've been sober because my parents found out after i had an extremely bad acid trip. Now i have nothing to even cope with anymore. Everyday living is such a pain and the only reason that i haven't ended everything is because of her, she said she wants to see me happy before she dies and i don't think i can do that. 

I don't have enough willpower to even try and help myself anymore, my emotions are so unstable and I've been on so many medications and seen so many therapists and nothing helps. I've gone through so many lows and suicide attempts and i thought i would've hit rock bottom by now but my emotions only get worse as the years go by. I'm just a waste of time and space. I feel like a burden to everyone. I have no friends except a couple online and now I even doubt their intentions and think they just pity me because i'm so paranoid that i'm a burden. 

I can't stop thinking about suicide or ways to do it. I can't stop hurting myself. I do nothing with my shitty life. I just stay at home and almost never go out or have any sort of interaction with actual people. My life used to be so good and I just ruined it all, i'm just a drug addicted fucking failure.

438,"I usually don't post on reddit, kind of scared to thanks to social anxiety leaking into the virtual world as well. But I have nowhere else to turn to right now so I'm forcing myself to post here.

I wholeheartedly believe I have no future. 

I am unemployed, and have no skills employers find desirable(I have been applying to many places for the past three years, trying different tips and tricks I found on the internet on how to make applications more likely to catch an employers eye, listing only relevant past jobs and volunteer work I did in highschool, and am still lucky to just get an email to let me know they don't want me).

I am absolutely dependent on my father for financial support as I don't have a single penny to my name nor a driver's license, but he only makes my emotional and mental state worse.

On the daily, he finds any small reason to blow up and tell me how much of a burden I am, despite doing everything he asks me to do. Dog had a small accident in the hallway, even though I walked them three-four times in two hours like he asked? Obviously I'm at fault and am a useless b!tch, I must have not walked them and lied about it. That's just one example.

He makes me feel like such dead weight, I feel guilty for even eating. So I don't. Why waste precious food that he spent his hard-earned money for on me? I'm already wasting his money by just using the toilet and showering, water bills are a thing.

And God forbid I try to tell him how I'm feeling. Somehow he'll turn it on me, saying I'm crazy, that I'm being disrespectful and ungrateful, that I shouldn't complain because he's keeping a roof over my head.

If I'm this much trouble, maybe everyone would be better off if I just died. No one would have to deal with me again. No one would ever have to carry me again and be disappointed in me again.

440,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on why I feel this way


Basically, I am a 24 year old female and ever since I was around 12, I've continually for different lengths of time went through periods where all I can think of is commiting suicide. 

Half the time, I do really want to die. I just think my life is terrible and there is no hope for me. I feel like life almost becomes too much, things affects me so much and just the thought of future life challenges just makes me want to end it. Almost as if I'm too weak. It is almost a comforting thought knowing it is an option. 

It is a constant feeling of how could I do it? where can I do it? when? I also think alot about how it'd affect people. When people hurt me, I go to that dark place and think well this would show you how much you've hurt me. Terribly selfish I know. 

The other half of the time I just think about it but I'm fairly certain I'd never do it. 

The times in my life when I don't think about suicide are when I have alot going on. When I have a busy/happy life. When I got to the age of 12 my parents started moving me around alot, so I've spent alot of my life alone. So I think this is what started it. I'm very close to my mum as she has been my best friend all my life but she is generally quite a sad and depressed person so I wonder if that has affected me to..

But even though I'm an adult now, it's still there. It feels like a dark cloud that's always there, waiting. Up until the start of lockdown, I hadn't had those feelings for around 2 years (maybe the occasionaly one but it was the happiest i'd ever been). So yeah, it's back.. how can I fix this? How can I fix myself?

448,"A short essay on how I'm a failure and all around piece of shit 


I never thought I had much of a purpose in life, and I'm okay with that fact, but I am sure that if I did have a purpose this isn't it and i am the only one to blame 

For starters I have always been a shitty person, not from the lack of trying to be better, just never being as good as I can be. My family is forced to love me because y'know being family and stuff, and I feel so fucking sorry for my friends cause they choose to hang around this waste of space. 


I had one friend thought I felt the most comfortable around, I could just be myself. I would do anything for him, and always wanted to be there to support him.

He killed himself

What kind of fucking pathetic asshole let's this happen. it's not like I didn't know what was going on, I just choose not to take action. I failed him on so many levels and I'll be eternally sorry to you max.but I do not deserve your forgiveness. The pain I feel now that your gone is more than I can bare, but it is pain I know I deserve to have.


My failure ways continue after hes gone though, even though my friends foolishly put there trust in me, I still care about them and want to help them through this as much as possible but I cant. I can't stop there pain or make them hurt less. Every word I speak pushes them further and further back. I want to help. Im doing the opposite. Knowing your hurting the people you love most is worse then any other I have ever felt. I failed max. And I continue to fail my other friends. 

Everything would be better if I killed myself, maybe not right away but people would get over me, and fuck it would be so much easier for me.

My mother is a  textbook narcissist and radical christian. I wouldn't say she was a terrible mother, but she certainly had her moments. She always passive aggressively attacks my sister for moving in with her boyfriend. She's all about how we were put on this earth only to suffer, and all that bullshit. It freaks my sister out every time she starts going on about any of that stuff.  I'm at home right now with my parents for summer break from college trying my best to be the mediator between my mom and my sister. My sister constantly comes to me for advice about what to do, even though I'm the younger brother. My dad on the other hand is one of my favorite people in the world, but I worry about him so much. He does all the work around the house, handles all the finances, 90% of the cooking and cleaning. Takes care of all the animals (I basically live on a farm), and nobody takes care of him.
