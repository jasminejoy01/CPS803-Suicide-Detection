5,"Hi, it's my first post here, I'm new in this community. So... I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for at least 8 years now. Today is my 25th birthday. Things have been extremely bad lately. I lost my job that I adored and I feel useless because of unemployment, I live in a country where unemployment rates are extremely high and my field of work doesn't have many opportunities. Even outside of it, it's hard to find work. I feel hopeless and it has made my suicidal thoughts much worse.

I actually plan to do it tonight. I had a shitty birthday and I really don't need to live a day more. Leading up to today, I've broken up with my girlfriend and pushed my family members away from me as much as possible, so it will lessen their pain. It hurts a lot, but it's for their own good.

I've tried therapy and medication, it helped briefly but my psychiatrist told me that my depression will keep coming back easily, I have family history of depression and suicide so it's no wonder. I can't keep going through this and bringing down my loved ones. I can't keep living like this.

I guess the reason I made this post is to vent. I don't know if I'm actually going to go through it tonight. I hope I'll be able to. My feelings have gone numb and I just want to close my eyes forever. I called a suicide hotline and the operator tried to guilt me into staying alive by telling me all about how my family will miss me... I know they will, but it will pass with time. I'm very worried about them, but I can't keep living for them. It's been the only reason I've kept living all these years... I can't do this anymore.

So, tonight might be the end. Sorry for venting. I'm keeping it a secret, obviously, but I felt like I had to tell someone, even anonymously on reddit. Goodbye.",suicide,"hi, it s my first post here, i m new in this community so  i ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for at least 8 years now today is my 25th birthday things have been extremely bad lately i lost my job that i adored and i feel useless because of unemployment, i live in a country where unemployment rates are extremely high and my field of work doesn t have many opportunities even outside of it, it s hard to find work i feel hopeless and it has made my suicidal thoughts much worse i actually plan to do it tonight i had a shitty birthday and i really don t need to live a day more leading up to today, i ve broken up with my girlfriend and pushed my family members away from me as much as possible, so it will lessen their pain it hurts a lot, but it s for their own good i ve tried therapy and medication, it helped briefly but my psychiatrist told me that my depression will keep coming back easily, i have family history of depression and suicide so it s no wonder i can t keep going through this and bringing down my loved ones i can t keep living like this i guess the reason i made this post is to vent i don t know if i m actually going to go through it tonight i hope i ll be able to my feelings have gone numb and i just want to close my eyes forever i called a suicide hotline and the operator tried to guilt me into staying alive by telling me all about how my family will miss me  i know they will, but it will pass with time i m very worried about them, but i can t keep living for them it s been the only reason i ve kept living all these years  i can t do this anymore so, tonight might be the end sorry for venting i m keeping it a secret, obviously, but i felt like i had to tell someone, even anonymously on reddit goodbye "

7,"I assume the person cutting is a girl but i‚Äôm not sure. I was scrolling through random hashtags about adhd because i have it. Then in a post i clicked a self harming hashtag. Then I saw her profile with 2 or 3 posts of her cutting herself. Very new, and its been 6 days since she‚Äôs first made the profile.

First attempt talking:
Titles herself as an unwanted person. She wants help, and I saw it and I fucking had to do something. I couldn‚Äôt just leave someone crying for heIp. I‚Äôve tried to talk to her using knowledge I‚Äôve read online. She doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me and replies with ‚Äúidk‚Äù constantly. So i said I‚Äôll leave her and told her to think about seeking a professional. Told her to remember it‚Äôll pass and some other things. So i stopped talking for 2 days.

Second attempt:
I came back to her profile account, and saw her new posts. She was trying to talk to me through her captions accompanied by photos with more cuts. She said ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt help me no one can‚Äù and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. 

So i messaged her/him again asking if she thought about seeking professional help yet. She wrote ‚Äúabout?‚Äù and ‚Äúty‚Äù and asked how old i was. She then posted on her profile page again with ‚Äúi need you but you don‚Äôt seem to need me üôÉüî´‚Äù with more fucking cuts...probably because it took me a while to respond since i didn‚Äôt see it. 
Back to the private messages. I said i was 19. She‚Äôs seen my message and hasn‚Äôt responded for about 4 hours now.

I then texted ‚Äúdo you live with your family‚Äù just recently. I need help right now. I need as much help to stop this, I can‚Äôt let this go.

11,"29F. Single for years because I can‚Äôt manage relationships. Lonely. Been depressed my whole adult life. Have bipolar and tend to fuck up my life in the brief periods of mania - scars, risky sex, and now a broken heel.

Non stop health problems. Endometriosis, a gut parasite leading to severe abdominal bloating non stop for the past 5 months, PCOS, acne.

Been chipping away at the degree for 5 years and am still only halfway through.

There is no hope for me. My body is fighting against me. In some ways it is permanently broken. I don‚Äôt want children or a partner, and yet without these I can‚Äôt see the point of life.

14,"This is my 5th or 6th bout of extreme depression, and every new one is harder than the one before. Last time, I tried to kill myself a few times and nothing worked, but I've gotten better at doing the drug calculations and I'm pretty sure they'll work if I try again. The only reason I can't right now, is because I have a dog and a cat who depend on me, and another dog who belongs to a friend, who I'm fostering (the dog, not the friend).

These are the things which are making me miserable -
1. I hate myself. I have no self worth and I cannot see myself as worth loving or being around. 
2. There is a guy I like. We kinda were together for a while, but we were long distance and then we broke. We occasionally text now and even though he acts the way he should (by this, I mean, pretty indifferent), I care more than I should. And that sucks. He's the only guy I've ever thought was good for me and even though I'm fully aware of his flaws, he was good for me, and it sucks that he doesn't really care.
3. I'm a grad student. I'm in the middle of my PhD. Even though I do love my work most of the time, sometimes, it hits me that I'm not doing what I always wanted to do. And maybe I never will. And even this, I feel very mediocre. And for someone who has always been am over achiever, this kind of just jogging along without proper progress is excruciating.
4. I've always wanted to do certain other things with my life even though doing a PhD was my primary goal. I wanted to write. I wanted to do something with music. I wanted to try spoken word poetry, I wanted to do other things and somehow none of those things are working out. It's a lack of opportunity, but it's also a severe lack of motivation as of right now. It's a vicious cycle.
5. My health has become crap. I keep trying to get better, but it's hard and a lack of motivation does not help.
6. I'm financially not doing well. That's not an issue, but my stipend will end before my PhD does, and that fear of the future is terrifying to me.
7. I've lost faith in God. It's like losing a limb. It sucks.
8. I cannot seem to find anyone who I like and who likes me and wants to be with me. I speak of both friends and relationships. I'm literally alone.
9. I'm of no significance to anyone. If I died tomorrow, nobody would even notice. And that's a stupid reason to want to die, but honestly, it makes it harder to want to live.

I'm fully aware that it's depression talking. I'm fully aware that this will pass some day and I'm fully aware that my problems are not that bad. But I haven't stopped crying for the last two days and I'm not even sure I can get through any more. I'm terrified I'll end up doing something to myself and that my animals will have no place to go.

29,"I am a Christian k cool we will start with that. 

I was abused by my father when I was 9 years old and verbally abused until 17 

My father finally left when I was 17 making my mom a very very dedicated psycho catholic 

The conflict that I‚Äôve had with her because of that means I have no family relationships anymore 
-         furthermore both Catholic families on both        father and mother side think I should go to hell since I‚Äôm Christian not catholic 

I‚Äôve been depressed since I was 10
I was bullied my whole life
Over the summer leading into my 8th grade year my best friend raped me. 
I was suicidal 8th-12th grade 

I had no friends and I had severe trust issues in everyone

I finally found people who helped me, and got me off the suicide train. By the time they helped me I attempted suicide at least a dozen times and contemplated it every single day. At the time I was an atheist. Those people helped me find God and life was good for a bit. 

Now those same people do things they know trigger ptsd from my past. They would talk about rape in front of me to trigger me. They would say I‚Äôm talking to them for attention despite me trying to make it very abundantly clear that I was trying to find a reason to live
They do things intentionally to make me depressed or suicidal so they have entertainment during this shit show of COVID. Every-time I asked them to stop they apologized to just do it over and over again. I developed a Stockholm syndrome effect with this group because they used to be so good for me, so I allowed myself to keep crawling back to be abused over and over again. 

They made me go from loving God to hating God so much that I wish I was an atheist again. I wouldn‚Äôt even call myself a Christian anymore that‚Äôs how much I hate God, the only reason I still believe is the logical argument behind it. 

With no family, no friends, no religion, no anything please tell me why I should be alive? It would be so much easier to just die and either be dead or go to heaven. What‚Äôs the point in living if you legitimately have no reason to want to live. The typical response on these threads is ‚Äúyour X will still care about you‚Äù but I don‚Äôt have that.

I don‚Äôt have any friends to turn to now when I‚Äôm depressed and suicidal.

Without going into too much detail, I forced a sexual act on my partner while she was asleep and drunk. I didn‚Äôt see it that way at the time, but the cold sober truth has hit me like a bullet - I raped the person I love most in this world.

She has experienced rape in the past, which only makes it more confusing why I did what I did. Why did I not recognise what I was doing? How could I let myself do that to her? I have no answer for these questions and the pain in her eyes has broken me. 

She hasn‚Äôt left me (yet) but I have left to house for a few days with our children to visit family and give her space (her request). The more time that passes the more the weight of my actions are pressing down on me. I have made it my only goal in life for almost 10 years, to keep her safe and make her happy. In one moment I‚Äôve then gone and broken every value I hold dear and shattered my own perception of who I am. She says she knows I never meant to do anything to hurt her and that she knows I am a good person with a kind heart. But how can that be true? I want more than anything for her to be ok, she has had such a long road to overcome her past traumas. She deserves better than me. My children deserve to have a father they can look up to. I can‚Äôt bear to see them look at me with total adoration knowing what I have done to their mother. 

When we arrived at my Mothers last night I tried to hang myself with a belt in the bathroom. But I couldn‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt know if I want to die but I know I can‚Äôt live knowing what I‚Äôve done. There is no way to fix it, nothing I can do to make it right. And the love and adoration of those closest to me feels like a mockery in my heart. She would be better if without me, but if I do kill myself I know that she would blame herself. And what damage would that do to my children...my world. But I just can‚Äôt live with the guilt and pain. I don‚Äôt know who I am, how I could do that. I wish I could just close my eyes and never wake up. I wish I never existed at all. But this isn‚Äôt a dream and my world is falling to pieces before my eyes. I deserve to die, but that would be selfish. I should carry the pain so that others don‚Äôt have to, but I don‚Äôt know if I can.

40,"I'm turning 22 next week - i'm spending July 4th alone today and I've cried a lot today. My suicidal thoughts started when I was 12, and I get to the point sometimes now where I'm like, really? They're still happening? I get really frustrated with myself because I try to do everything ""right"" and the ""healthy way"". I try exercising. I try eating well. I have a boyfriend I've known since High school. I have friends and a sister who I care about deeply. I am a straight A student in college hoping to go into the psychology field. And yet, this whole time, almost on a near daily basis, I just wish I was dead. It is not obvious on the outside - people think i'm a funny and happy person. I make people laugh and I present myself in a positive way when I'm out. But inside, it just fucking hurts all the time.   


In high school, I called the suicide hotline twice and never told anyone. It helped at the time, the woman stayed on the phone with me for an hour before announcing that she had to go. Therapy has been helpful too, but from my experience, I haven't found a foolproof ""cure"" to not wanting to hurt myself.  I self harmed for years and never told anyone about that either, and even five years later when I no longer hurt myself, the desire to want to die is still there. I am doing things ""right"", but it doesn't seem to matter. 

My freshman year of college I ended up in the hospital due to an illness. I was on bedrest for three months, alone in my room. I couldn't see anyone or talk to anyone. My boyfriend was several hours away at school. I was living with my parents who seemed to make issues worse. All I saw on social media was my 18 year old friends getting drunk and studying abroad. It solidified in my mind that my life was pointless.

I never tell people because I feel like when I used to express suicidal thoughts, they didn't really help me. It's fucking horrible. I've been in therapy for about three years and we talk about my past trauma a lot, but I'm always too afraid to say how hard it is for me because I feel like it's implied. I'm afraid to really be honest with anyone because people can be so judgy and mean.

I know these thoughts stems from my depression, anxiety, and PTSD as a result of an abusive childhood, but knowing the cause doesn't seem to help. All I can use to describe it is immense pain all the time. And obviously, life doesn't help. There's the stress of college, finances, love and lack of it, new trauma, and change. I hate talking to anyone because I feel like I'm constantly complaining, but I also know that I need help. Life is hard. This year alone, I went to two funerals, had to call the police on a roommate who tried to take naked pictures of me underneath my bedroom door, and lived out of suitcase in my boyfriend's room because our college was shut down because of COVID. I lost my job and what little income I had, and being inside for 5 months has increased these thoughts again because I no longer have distractions. This on top of my recurring nightmares and insomnia about my abusive parents has brought me to the point of just wanting it to stop. There is no happiness. There used to be short moments, but now there's nothing.

I guess this is just me venting. I'm so sad that I'm spending another birthday this year wishing that someone else had my life instead of me. I wish I could talk about these thoughts without everyone in my life being dismissive, mean, or weird about them. I get thrown away as a ""sensitive emotional woman with mommy/daddy issues"" when in reality every day I make the choice to keep living. I tell myself I do it for everyone else, but if it came down to it, I'm not sure I would keep myself alive for me.

49,"I‚Äôve been fighting a war that I can‚Äôt win. Depression, suicide attempts, alcoholism, and compulsive gambling. I took a really hard look in the mirror and realized my time here is coming in an end. No one can talk me out of it this time. My first attempt was a little over two years ago (thanks to my partner at the time screaming ‚Äúfucking kill yourself‚Äù) and I‚Äôm so tired of the pain and loss.

The pain of having a long term partner cheat. The pain of my best friend overdosing. The pain of losing all trust in myself. I can‚Äôt go without a day about thinking about dying.

Once I made the plans and wrote out what I need to do before I go (write letters, clean, make amendments, etc.) I finally felt peace. There‚Äôs a tremendous amount of happiness surrounding the idea that I won‚Äôt be here much longer. Happy tears. It‚Äôs a permanent solution to a permanent problem.

The addict inside me needs to be stopped. The suicide hotline hung up on me. My regular therapist that I‚Äôve been seeing for two years is quitting his practice. My dreams have been crushed. I‚Äôm in debt. This is the final chapter- I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôve fought too long and it‚Äôs time to give up.

I don‚Äôt want to be 25 and already have more relapses than I can count. I‚Äôm done failing. I‚Äôm done disappointing others. I‚Äôm done causing conflicts that could be easily avoidable if I was simply not me. I love everything and everyone, but I truly hate what‚Äôs in the mirror. My mind is constantly persuaded by guilt and hate. The things I do are singular, detached from anything and everyone. There‚Äôs no origin. No one‚Äôs fault but my own. Remember that.

 And with this said, I say goodbye. It‚Äôs a sweet goodbye like a sunset after a long day at the beach. It needs to happen- innately natural, at least to me.

67,"Not really a suicidal post, but i definitely don't know where to go from here.

I will do it at some point, haven't really thought out when yet.

&#x200B;

without further ado the explanation as to why;

&#x200B;

I feel like everything, has come to the worst definitive outcome of my life.

And somehow i wished for it to happen at one point but then, when i mostly needed everything came true?

&#x200B;

The pent of feelings i had as a teenager;

&#x200B;

I wished for my father to die, because i was so stuck up with him.

I wished to never fall in love, because i didn't deserve it.

I wished to be damned, like a religion, because of the way i was treated around with my friends.

&#x200B;

For a while i thought; these were just the feelings i had as a child since i was naive.

Since my father, did love me.

He was in fact the only person who cared so deeply. 

And i can only see that now.

&#x200B;

I falled in love; with a girl over the summer after my father died.

Then i got cheated on, and the worst part she never acknowledged it.

Knowing i could handle it, as i was open for her having open relationships. 

&#x200B;

All these 2; came into my own damnation like a religion, my friends came to believe my side of the story.

But also due to that, they never saw me as the same thing anymore.

&#x200B;

Every day seems like a struggle; and i do smile, i do laugh.

But deep inside; i'm crying.

&#x200B;

I refused to give up before, and i'm still doing that, i just don't know for how long.

Till i finally collapse.

&#x200B;

To top this whole story off, i hate racism.

I loathe people who hate one another just because of a color,race or what other people did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And with that said, my mom got a new boyfriend who, is exactly like that.

He works in a prison, but he hates and loathes about race so so much.

I can't listen to him; and yet i do.

Because i can't cause drama/i won't.

It's because i also hate drama.

I don't like it, neither does me writing this whole story like what i just wrote.

But, sometimes you just have to, write your own feelings out.

&#x200B;

I want to move out,

Away from all this.

&#x200B;

But i know this project will take another 2 years before i finally move out of the house.

&#x200B;

Then is the question then what, what do i do when i moved out. 

&#x200B;

Maybe that will resolve itself,

I just hope it doesn't involve in me; going into spirals again.

70,"It was already looking friendly when the world started going to hell but with the fact my mom and I are gonna be evicted from our house at the end of the month. We have no money or time to pack up, find a place and move into a new place (especially with trying to find a temporary place for our birds to stay until we get settled) and ya know... We're in the middle of a damn pandemic and my mom is in the category of high risk for covid. 

Before anyone asks our landlord waited until our states restrictions on evictions was lifted (which was on the first) before hitting us with the eviction notice. 

After I went through the rapid wave if emotions, crying my eyes out and just laying in bed for several hours straight, my brain just emotionally shut down. For the last few years I've been just chugging along, clinging to hope that things will at least stay stable and I could focus on my goals of being an artist. But now I feel nothing. I spent time with bf and I just faked a smile to seem fine but I just couldn't bring myself to find happiness which I know isn't fair to him.
Mom and I have been through a lot of shit and have scrapped by by the skin of our teeth but I just don't see how we can possibly pull through this. 

I've been contemplating swallowing all of my pills, taking enough meletonin to put myself to sleep and hope I just go in my sleep. I know the chances of success are slim but better then my other plan which is stop drinking and eating or to just yeet myself off the overpass. 

Am I selfish and a coward for wanting to die, yes but I'm just tired of fighting against the world only to get pushed down and spit on. I know mom will be devastated as will my friends and other loved ones (mom especially since my older sister passed away a couple years ago) but hopefully they'll understand that I'm weak and just can't keep going anymore just to be a burden on them.

I had nothing to lose, I took big risks and fought like hell.  

I‚Äôm on medications now that I swore I‚Äôd never take, and guess what?   My depression appears to be treatment resistant.

I dislike nearly everything about myself from the way I look - the way I speak - the way I work - the way I interact with people. There was a time where I was outgoing, tried really hard in school and with my hobbies, and actively made an effort - but i'm the completely opposite now.

I don't have many good friends because I alienate myself and believe if someone is being friendly and wants to hang out with me - they're either just doing it as a charity or they'll just be disappointed and find out i'm not who they thought i was. I never speak up because I think everything I say is dumb or just not worth saying, I don't find myself interesting at all, and I always immediately assume I'm the least valuable person in a room and am automatically below everyone. I'm very lonely and hold myself back in every single way. I overthink and criticize EVERYTHING I do and any decision I make. I just want to feel and think normally, and not be so in my head. I know life has it's ups and downs and i've had a positive outlook through it all but i'm absolutely exhausted now even though my life is just getting started.

I've tried to make efforts to better myself and at least somewhat like myself by speaking to a doctor - was diagnosed with ADHD and Depression and have been taking mediation for about a year - but there's not much improvement. I work out and try to push myself to gain new experiences but feel so awkward in my own skin and mind. I even feel awkward talking to my doctor (who is absolutely wonderful btw) but always hold back and don't mention how I feel suicidal on a weekly basis, that I genuinely don't like myself, that i'm miserable, and hide all that by talking about my frustrations with my work ethic and motivation.

I'm in my 20s and want to take FULL advantage of this time in myself, but it's so difficult to when I feel cemented to my bed and wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.

Often times I truly believe I'm not cut out for life and would be better suited as an observer and watch others make the best of their lives instead of me. What would I be like when I'm older? Apparently I'm great at my job but feel like I'm terrible at it and have no motivation to improve even when my mind is yelling at me to, so how could I handle being promoted and move up when I feel too dumb to manage people or command a room or feel confident in my work? How could I be in a relationship when I believe a man of high-value would be absolutely insane to even like me enough to commit to me? How could I make life-long friends when I alienate everyone? How can I take care of children or even a pet when I'm too exhausted to take care of myself? Etc. etc.

96,"I'm technically still enrolled as a uni student, but i haven't gone to uni nor did my final research for the last 6 months. Rn i'm just at home doing anything i can to 'have fun' at home. I was born a loner anyway so i don't get even more depressed by staying at home and becoming anti-social. (I have been ignoring my friends & other ppl's messages). I ran out of things to do so why not write this anyway. I'm going to rant A HELL LOT so it's going to be a long long story. Again, because writing this takes a lot of time, and i need to kill a lot of time. Here's the TL;DR. Anyway it's just a rant as a replacement for not being able to open up to anyone. Maybe it can be an interesting story for those needing inspiration or smth. It's a little step for feeling a little better, so why not. Not that i'll stop being a NEET.

**TL;DR:** I was doing great at uni but out of nowhere i became depressed. Struggled and struggled for 2+ years, tried almost everything, but my depression only got worse. Seriously attempted suicide without getting caught/leave marks. Wanted to tried a better method but then quarantine came. Afraid of getting caught, now i'm a NEET. After becoming much calmer as a NEET, decided to wait for myself to die naturally or wait 1-2 years until i can't take it anymore and kill myself. Already given up on recovering / getting on with life, it'll only get  me even more depressed and i'll kill myself earlier. Why did i became depressed? It's probably a multi-factorial thing + some genetics. I'm just out of luck. I'm not going back.

\-------

**Edit**: ha, i don't want anyone i know recognize me from my 'highly specific' rant so i deleted the long long rant. leaving only the afterthought behind. still, it felt good writing them down, killed lots of time... no i didn't cried writing this lol. Here it is:

(after struggling & struggling, cancelled my suicide plan)... So then i opted for the second best option, becoming a NEET.

I felt a big relieve, honestly. I was happy because i didn't cried for days straight. Only cried a little once a week or two. Of course this is not the perfect solution. I did everything i could to distract myself, to enjoy my 'new life'. Well, things to do are running out. No matter how i run away from it, a depressed person will always lose interest at anything eventually. I honestly thought it was better for me to become a game/anime/porn addict. tried to become one, but of course i failed. So what i'm going to do is to wait for the time to either die naturally or for the depression to catch up to me to the point of suicide. I guess the later will come first in 1-2 years. these 6 months already feels like more than a year.

I am NOT going to try therapy & to get going again. I'm sick of the medication, it only made me worse and gave me bad tremors. Although i can look for another psychiatrist, i honestly don't want to struggle anymore. Struggling makes me very tired emotionally, and that will worsen my depression. I'm not going to try opening up to anyone either, i'm tired of trying to do that. i will explain this a little more below. In one word, i don't want to cry and struggle anymore. If there'll be a time i want to give up so bad, i want to just give up and be done with it. Time will tell wether i'll really give up or not, but the time is not now. well again, if i don't give up i'll probably stay as a NEET and die as one.

Oh, did i mention that i choke myself? Cutting is a no-no for me. It leaves scars, a big red flag. Not that i didn't tried, but i don't like the pain/sensation either way. Before i find choking myself the best, i hit my head to the floor.

For those who are curious on what causing my problems here, i already thought a decent hypothesis. I suspect that my mom had a depression in her mid 20s-30s, so my problem could be partly genetics. I mentioned that i tried so hard to open up myself to a friend/family, but i just can't. Looking back, there's always a wall that i keep up even with my trusted friends. I'm everybody's friend but never someone's best best friend. I always put a mask, wether i want to or not. And in all honesty, i don't really care about them either even if they died. Yes, that probably applies for my parents too. So i just happen to have a bad personality. Me being busy at uni was not helping my condition either. Although it was my choice, i didn't know i was depressed so tough luck for me. I once checked for thyroid hormones but they came back normal so that's not the answer. My period is always regular so it's not gonodal hormones / cyst either. Brain tumour? haha either that or that the combination of bad genetics, bad personalities, and unlucky circumstances is what has driven me crazy. Depression is like cancer, you know? it's multifactorial, caused by god knows how many possible mechanisms.

One regret i have is that i didn't get to finish my studies before breaking down like this. I thought i could at least get to submit my thesis and be done with it for the rest of my life. Didn't even plan to attend the graduation. I wanted to get out from society without any 'debts' left, a clean cut.

103,"I guess I'm still not in danger, because I thought when you're really in danger and you have a plan, you get a feeling of peace. At least I have some peace in the sense that, if I do get to where I can't think of any way not to go through with it, I've set out a couple of rules for myself to make the best of it. Like, I know where I'd do it, to make sure my kids aren't at risk of finding me. I'm finally drunk enough to stop fucking crying for the first time in... 14 hours now, looks like. Nothing's going to make this better. I'm in therapy. I'm on meds. My spouse is super supportive and I have literally everything to live for. And still here I am, thinking about how I'll make sure my kids have someone to look to when I'm gone. This is the only place I can say anything, because when I do make an attempt, I'm too careful to make a cry for help or try something that might not work. If it gets to that, nobody's going to know until I'm gone.

Just like when I called the suicide hotline 20 years ago, when I first had thoughts of dying, and I just sobbed that it was stupid of me to call because I was probably fine and they said okay. I'm way too self-controlled to say something like this if I were actually about to do something; I'd just do it. I'm so fucking tired of not being sick enough.

I'm not even looking for help. I can't imagine what anybody could do and I never get responses from anybody, anywhere. I just get more and more isolated as time goes on, the harder I work to face my fears and reach out. It's just that I don't have anybody else who understands. The people who care about me worry too much and my psychiatrist and therapist worry too little. I've never fit and I'm never going to.",suicide,"i guess i m still not in danger, because i thought when you re really in danger and you have a plan, you get a feeling of peace at least i have some peace in the sense that, if i do get to where i can t think of any way not to go through with it, i ve set out a couple of rules for myself to make the best of it like, i know where i d do it, to make sure my kids aren t at risk of finding me i m finally drunk enough to stop fucking crying for the first time in  14 hours now, looks like nothing s going to make this better i m in therapy i m on meds my spouse is super supportive and i have literally everything to live for and still here i am, thinking about how i ll make sure my kids have someone to look to when i m gone this is the only place i can say anything, because when i do make an attempt, i m too careful to make a cry for help or try something that might not work if it gets to that, nobody s going to know until i m gone just like when i called the suicide hotline 20 years ago, when i first had thoughts of dying, and i just sobbed that it was stupid of me to call because i was probably fine and they said okay i m way too self controlled to say something like this if i were actually about to do something i d just do it i m so fucking tired of not being sick enough i m not even looking for help i can t imagine what anybody could do and i never get responses from anybody, anywhere i just get more and more isolated as time goes on, the harder i work to face my fears and reach out it s just that i don t have anybody else who understands the people who care about me worry too much and my psychiatrist and therapist worry too little i ve never fit and i m never going to "

111,"Okay so to preface this is in no way sexual, it‚Äôs purely just a form of escapism that has developed for me the last few days or so. I‚Äôm posting this wondering if anyone else can relate to this. 

Lately I‚Äôve started getting deep into this fantasy of inciting my own murder. I imagine how I would find someone to do it, what they would look like, how they would do it, etc. Like today I‚Äôve been thinking about a timeline where I post on reddit somewhere inciting for someone to kill me. They contact me and I tell them that I want to be shot point blank from behind while I‚Äôm walking somewhere. We pick the date and the location and discuss what to do with my body. I‚Äôve been constantly thinking about a way I can escape all this pain I‚Äôm in all the time and it‚Äôs gotten to the point where the thought of someone murdering me is more comforting than the thought of having to live any longer. I feel like everything in my life is telling me that I should die. I‚Äôm considering going to this bridge that goes over the river in my city, it‚Äôs very high up. I want to just sit on the edge at the top of it and look at the water and feel how high up I am. The thought of that is also comforting. If I felt like it I could just jump off and it would all be over. If I got drunk and went up there I know I would do it. I have no doubt. I guess I‚Äôm just conflicted. I‚Äôm still trying to hold onto hope but I don‚Äôt think I can ever really get better. I feel like my issues are too ingrained and there‚Äôs too many. Even if I could fix them do I have it in me to work that hard for that long? I hate myself so deeply I don‚Äôt even think I deserve to feel better if I‚Äôm honest. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about anymore. This post went on a complete tangent.

118,"I keep looking back on my life, and I can't help but feel like the universe is trying to kill me.

Literally from the moment I was born, I had a breathing issue that had to be dealt with. Less than a year later, I got a very bad case of the flu and had to get hospitalized. A few years ago, I slipped on something (still no idea what the fuck it was), hit my head, and could've bled out if the doctor hadn't hurried the fuck up.

I'm also being driven to suicide by bullshit that's not my fault. I'm bisexual, so of course both of my parents seem to be biphobic. I've been to four different schools, two of which have consisted of mostly bullies and homophobes. At one of my schools, even the teachers hated me even though I was a well behaved student. It also doesn't help that I'm autistic, so going through all of this shit while only being able to keep one friend is tough.

On the topic of my one friend, for literally no reason, I've just lost all interest in talking to him. I like him and he's really nice, I just lost interest for no reason. Then that makes me feel lonely, and I feel horrible for not wanting to talk to him, which makes me even more depressed and even closer to suicide.

There are only two things that have stopped me from suicide. One is my cat, one of the few beings on this planet who actually fucking cares about me. The other is just a lack of planning. I don't know how I would even do it.

If the universe is out to kill me, can it please hurry? I want to fall asleep tonight and never wake up. That would literally be the best thing to ever happen to me.

123,"I posted here 12 days ago but I wasnt really successful with my suicide. Turns out stabbing is hard. Last June 3 my uncle (the one sponsoring my college) found out I didn't enroll. He told my grandma who told my mom. My mom was so angry and she beat me up and she said she was so ashamed she wished I were dead. I took it by heart and I was at my lowest at that time. By midnight I was gonna kill myself but I fell asleep. June 4, 4:00 am I went to the woods to stab myself but I was such a coward, it was really hard for me to do it and pieces of advice I got from reddit especially from a friend named David just went to my head. By 6 am I got up and went home telling myself things will get better. 12 pm my dad called (he only goes home by fridays to weekends) because he heard the news from my aunt (istg my relatives are all under our noses) so my dad called me saying that he was so angry I should pack up and runaway. I begged him I dont want to. By 2pm he was coming home so I picked up the kitchen knives and ran away to the woods. I was hiding there and I was planning to stab my neck by nighttime. I was just so confused; I wasnt angry, I wasn't sad. I felt empty and in pain and I just wanted to die. I heard shuffling footsteps by 5 pm and voila my mom found me. I was just so scared she was shouting at me to go home and face my dad. She got this big chunk of wood she beat me up till we got home. (idk how she found me tho) So I got home, faced my dad, and behold the most amazing man I will ever see. He listened to me and sympathized with me. He told me I should've told him about my problems because my mind is still very vulnerable and young. I didn't tell him about how suicidal I am. My mental state is still a sham to Filipino families. The only thing he didnt like about what I did was how this would bring shame to my fam since we are poor and my siblings' education lies on the judgemental hands of my rich relatives.  Anyways he told me I should just get a job within two months to help with the financial problems. My only problem right now is how to face my uncle and all the relatives who would be saying Im an ungrateful, good for nothing, eldest daughter who dropped out from an oh so amazing career, with that private expensive prestigious med school.

Hour by hour I can feel myself slipping. I have almost no hope left. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone at all, haven‚Äôt for a week, it‚Äôs just been me, a game and my thoughts. For me, there is no help. No medicine, no therapy is going to bring back what I lost. I can‚Äôt fight anymore. I‚Äôm so tired of holding on. I don‚Äôt even know if I should wait another day, to see if the person I love will come back, or a few days until my mail comes, or just do it now in the dead of night.

If I cannot even form an understanding with others, then what difference does it make if I'm alive or dead? And since this causes me so much frustration and grief, why indeed wouldn't I just end it?

132,"Hey.

so I have made a post in the subreddit about My first ex and how I am trying to cope,

my ex is currently still at home. He would have been shipped out to D.C. but since the rodeo is crazy, he is coding from his home here where he grew up.

so I am about 6 months out after he broke up from me. I‚Äôm not the best, but better then January we have been keeping in Touch in very light ways, not too much detail. He wanted to make sure he didn‚Äôt kill me I think. And he would let me throw a tantrum in these texts about how I hate my life, my 2700 debt, my lack of education, how I feel like I‚Äôm in so little control. being an Aspie.

, i have a blow up and settle down to a still unhappy Simmer. this was March- June.

today out of the blue, he texts me around noon to take me to ice cream. With his buddy. And I feel like im getting back to normal, I felt his eyes were still very pretty, but I focused on being a friend and it goes well.

i am about to sleep, but then I text him a thank you about the ice cream, and that‚Äôs when the I.v. Of casual pain started.

I was causally showed his new boyfriend. He looks like a better, sexier, beefier me. My eye color, my chest hair, my beefy build. He is disabled like me, has a troubled past like me, is insecure like me.

And then goes on to explain how they met a month ago, how they already signed a lease for a 3,000 dollar a month apartment. And I‚Äôm taking his in and acting like I care, just not in the painful amount it does.

It‚Äôs been a very short time in my perspective. And I‚Äôm already replaceable. I‚Äôm just as replacable as the A.i . Man fiend he makes for his work.

And I‚Äôm telling him it hurts a little to hear this stuff, but inside, I‚Äôm taken back to when he first dumped me months ago I wanted to hand myself with the extension cord, but the only thing that I got was that I could nit stand up I was that upset.

Hearing about how he would do things sexually to him and how much I really wanted him to do those things to me. When we dated.( his eyes were pretty, but if I‚Äôm being pervy, he has the cutest brown-orangish Mexican bubble butt). 

Ans I acted like I was proud of him, I am. I really am. Just it feels like that guy is a stand in for me.

I‚Äôm ashamed to say I still care for him. Aspie habits die hard.

I wanted to die a couple hours ago...

But my estranged mom picked up the phone when I called, and I cried like a bitch to my mom for the first time in 10years.

‚ÄúI miss him.‚Äù I would say.

‚Äú you miss him keeping you a dirty secret?‚Äù She would reply, and I would feel better I‚Äôve rate course of an hour.

That happening on my birthday made me feel even more guilty because I was aware of what he was doing but I kept it from my parents because I was afraid that he would would get physical with me, having had a traumatic past with men, mind you, my parents live in another country. I have a lot of problems which have affected me in general, although I act like everything is okay. Having African parents, I‚Äôm afraid to tell them anything about how I feel, because they‚Äôll start asking questions I don‚Äôt want to answer. I‚Äôd rather speak to someone who doesn‚Äôt know anything about me and can‚Äôt judge me. I always isolate myself especially during this quarantine, I never leave my room, only when it‚Äôs necessary. My whole life is complicated, I moved from my home country to live with my two brothers in Canada. My grades weren‚Äôt perfect in my old school but they‚Äôre a lot better here cause the courses aren‚Äôt as hard as back home. So me having good grades makes my parents think I‚Äôm okay but I‚Äôm not.

159,"My step mother has just told me she wanted to kill herself. And I don't know what to do.
Recently, I could tell some things were wrong in the relationship between my father and her.
There were as an argument that shook the house late at night, my step mother began to sleep downstairs on the sofa.

I knew something was wrong. I thought this would all work out eventually. As this isn't the first time a problem has occurred between them. But no this was bad. Lately I could tell she was upset throughout the days I was with her.
But at my own stupid fault I ignored it, thinking it would just blow over.

My father is constantly at work, and she is mostly left alone with her two young children. On the days me and my brother come, we just stay upstairs or stick to the PlayStation. We don't really spend any time with her, as we are just teenagers wanting to be left alone. 

But yesterday, she started to tell me things how she wished I would grow up and get a house so she could live with me as she hated it here. I kinda brushed it off. But later on in the day when I had just finished eating, she came in and had got some food for herself. As I was about to leave she told me to sit down with her, so I did. 

We started talking, and I asked what had happened between my dad and her. She began to talk about how people were selfish and eventually said that she sometimes thought she should just kill herself. I rushed to her holding tell her not to think such thoughts and how everything is going to be OK. 
 
I held her hand and told her not to worry, how everything was going to work out. I asked what really happened. She began ot tell me how she put trust in another family of ours. Talking to this person all the time but the person was recording their conversations. I don't know what she said, but I know when my dad found out he wasn't happy. And that's what probably struck the argument earlier. 

My dad even took her phone off her, and now all she does these days is sit at home with nothing to do. 
She then told me how she wanted to learn how to drive but my dad wouldn't let her. I don't know if any abuse has happened but I wouldn't be surprised. 

As my father did use to beat up my actual mother. 
I love my step mother, as she was a mother for me when my own mother couldn't be one. I stook with her throughout the rest of our conversation and we even did some puzzles together. I even checked up on her before I went to sleep.

And now I'm scared of what to do and how to help her, I'm definitely going to try and stick with her tomorrow. But I soon will have to go to my actual mothers house for a couple of days. And then she will be left alone again. I don't know what to do form here. I wanna help her and I don't want to lose her. 
Could someone please advise me on how to help her.",suicide,"my step mother has just told me she wanted to kill herself and i don t know what to do recently, i could tell some things were wrong in the relationship between my father and her there were as an argument that shook the house late at night, my step mother began to sleep downstairs on the sofa i knew something was wrong i thought this would all work out eventually as this isn t the first time a problem has occurred between them but no this was bad lately i could tell she was upset throughout the days i was with her but at my own stupid fault i ignored it, thinking it would just blow over my father is constantly at work, and she is mostly left alone with her two young children on the days me and my brother come, we just stay upstairs or stick to the playstation we don t really spend any time with her, as we are just teenagers wanting to be left alone but yesterday, she started to tell me things how she wished i would grow up and get a house so she could live with me as she hated it here i kinda brushed it off but later on in the day when i had just finished eating, she came in and had got some food for herself as i was about to leave she told me to sit down with her, so i did we started talking, and i asked what had happened between my dad and her she began to talk about how people were selfish and eventually said that she sometimes thought she should just kill herself i rushed to her holding tell her not to think such thoughts and how everything is going to be ok  i held her hand and told her not to worry, how everything was going to work out i asked what really happened she began ot tell me how she put trust in another family of ours talking to this person all the time but the person was recording their conversations i don t know what she said, but i know when my dad found out he wasn t happy and that s what probably struck the argument earlier my dad even took her phone off her, and now all she does these days is sit at home with nothing to do she then told me how she wanted to learn how to drive but my dad wouldn t let her i don t know if any abuse has happened but i wouldn t be surprised as my father did use to beat up my actual mother i love my step mother, as she was a mother for me when my own mother couldn t be one i stook with her throughout the rest of our conversation and we even did some puzzles together i even checked up on her before i went to sleep and now i m scared of what to do and how to help her, i m definitely going to try and stick with her tomorrow but i soon will have to go to my actual mothers house for a couple of days and then she will be left alone again i don t know what to do form here i wanna help her and i don t want to lose her could someone please advise me on how to help her "

If reincarnation existed would u like to die? 

Just so u can re-live another day where you can get the chance to get a normal life

I was home-schooled half of 
7th, 8th, & 9th grade because of the lack of social skills that I had, social anxiety and later on depression
This lasted around 7th - 10th grade. 

Taking this online school made me graduate high-school early at the age of 15.
 (I kind of cheated through it though)
But I still got an easy Diploma

I'd say for two years of my life I did nothing. 

From the ages of 15 through 16

Until I reached the age of 17.
I did do one year of college for hospitality management 

Likewise. Things did not get better for me since then

I am still both socially awkward, isolated and depressed.
I am bored of life. helpless.‚ù§ I have no friends, in which whom I can't relate to. 

I live for what I like and love to eat. I barely have any hobbies besides cooking, singing, and drawing a little and watching YouTube. 

My parents are very little when it comes to acknowledging my future.

I am a cosigner for an apartment with my father until middle of next year, what's the best way to shield family from leasing agency retaliation?

It's safe to assume that committing suicide on private property is a huge headache for business owners. However the most effective way I can see to guarantee death would be to rent a gun from range and leave the body in an easily sanitized area.  Goal is to go quietly and efficiently with as little concern from others as possible and as cheaply as possible. Would a gun range have liability immunity in this case?

Finally I want to guarantee the body be recycled/donated and no memorial/funeral service is conducted. Do I need a lawyer to be executor of this or can I simply get a notary or cheaper/simpler alternative?

173,"I either live until I die naturally or I kill myself. Neither makes any difference to me or the universe.

Living is hard. Circumstances don't matter, I just hate living. I used to think I felt bad because of external reasons but I've come to understand that I just hate existence itself.

Suicide is freedom. 

Suicide is easy.

Suicide is selfish.

It would destroy my father and my sister. I love them. I don't want to hurt them. 

But that in and of itself does not allow me to keep living. 

It's equally selfish to make them my reason to live. That implies that whenever I get hurt me it's their fault for forcing me to be alive. Eventually I'll come to hate them for forcing me to endure the pain of being alive. Sometimes I already do.

I can't die because of them, but I also can't live a life I hate just because of them. 

To go on living I need to make peace with myself and find my own motivation. Nobody else can do that for me, and I don't know how to do it myself. My only other options are suicide or killing myself with anti depressants. The part of me that hates being alive is me. Without it I'll just be an empty shell of a human.",suicide,"i either live until i die naturally or i kill myself neither makes any difference to me or the universe living is hard circumstances don t matter, i just hate living i used to think i felt bad because of external reasons but i ve come to understand that i just hate existence itself suicide is freedom suicide is easy suicide is selfish it would destroy my father and my sister i love them i don t want to hurt them but that in and of itself does not allow me to keep living it s equally selfish to make them my reason to live that implies that whenever i get hurt me it s their fault for forcing me to be alive eventually i ll come to hate them for forcing me to endure the pain of being alive sometimes i already do i can t die because of them, but i also can t live a life i hate just because of them to go on living i need to make peace with myself and find my own motivation nobody else can do that for me, and i don t know how to do it myself my only other options are suicide or killing myself with anti depressants the part of me that hates being alive is me without it i ll just be an empty shell of a human "

But I'm still worried, they're very self-destructive and self-degrading and they struggle with opening up about their problems, thoughts, and feelings. And then there is me, a perfectly happy, and energetic person. 
To make matters worse, my lover is long-distance, they live states away from me. So what I can really do is limited, so what can I do? I'm doing my best and doing all the right things, like comfort, treating them humanely, and giving them their own time and space to speak about it. Yet, I'm still worried.

My lack of sexual experience hindered me in college so I never tried. To summarize my 20s, I applied to medical school after college, did not get in, so I did a Ph.D in Biology which took 7 years. At 29 I applied to medical school again and got in. ***During my 20s, due to my virginity I also became a porn addict.  I also became obese in my 20s.***

I did Internal Medicine Residency for 3 years (***during which i changed my diet and worked out becoming in good shape***) then Oncology (Cancer Doctor) for another 4 (including a research year). ***I lost my virginity to a hooker. I also hired a ""sexual surrogate"" (basically a ""intimacy/sex"" teacher---GOOGLE IT) to ""teach"" me how to kiss/have sex.*** ***I had a 2 short relationships but my sexual inexperience ruined them.***

&#x200B;

I now make $400,000/year and am dating a hot blonde waitress (I always loved blondes) somehow. Still the insecurity ***DOES NOT GO AWAY***. I still get ***anxiety*** about sex. ***It does not make me happy. The pain of the wasted youth does not go away and becomes an OBSESSION. I will never know what it feels like to have sex as a teenager (or in my 20s) with raging hormones WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BUT MY PARENTS DID NOT ALLOW ME TO DATE OR HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. THIS IN ITS OWN WAY IS MORE EXCRUCIATING THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.***

***PICTURE WINNING A POWERBALL TICKET FOR $300 MILLION DOLLARS AND BEING FORCED TO THROW IT AWAY. THIS IS WHAT HIGH SCHOOL FELT LIKE FOR ME.*** I grew up rich (dad was a neurosurgeon, mom was an obgyn) so the ***money is meaningless to me....it does not make me happy.***

&#x200B;

I suppose I should be happy about what I have now. ***Well I CAN'T***. Life never will be the same or the way it should have been. ***I realize there probably will not be any sympathy for me in this forum***, but I am here to tell you that ***THE PAIN OF A WASTED YOUTH NEVER GOES AWAY*** ***EVEN IF YOU SUPPOSEDLY GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT***.  

ALSO HERE TO SAY THAT OFTEN TIMES IN LIFE ***PEOPLE WHO YOU WOULD NEVER EXPECT TO BE SUICIDAL KILL THEMSELVES.  I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.***

241,"Why is everyone else here? How do you guys hold on? I feel like I'm going to give up any day now, with no real plan beyond some kind of cathartic ending that leaves everyone with very little closure or comfort. I finally convinced my doctors to take me off all my medication in March, something I was in fact very proud about. I was actually feeling really great, right up until I tried to kill myself on April 17th.

Every day since then has been anxiety attacks and violent thoughts towards myself, with an underlying inability to cope with even the smallest inconveniences. It's important to mention that I don't think of my suicide attempt as a mistake, just a failure. Had there been any success I wouldn't be whining to you guys now. It's simply the misery of knowing I'm still alive when I have no reason to live that really kills me. The one thing that haunted me the worst after I survived, wasn't a memory or effect, or anything I had felt; I just couldn't stop wondering why I am still alive.

It's been 77 days since I tried, and every day I've wanted to try again. I finally gave in and decided to talk to my doctor about medications, because the anxiety attacks that have followed my suicide attempt have made living basically unbearable. What once was a mildly off putting occasional gift, became a consistent plight on regular life, and somehow I still can't help but feel like I'm giving up. I was so proud of getting off medication and now that I feel myself about to have to go on them again I feel like I'm moving backwards. All this progress for nothing, and all that.

Then again it's the apathy that really hits me the hardest. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to talk to people anymore, I don't want to watch movies anymore. I don't want to play video games anymore, or work out, or research, or anything else I'd loved so much. I don't even want to sleep, but sleeping is the easiest way to ignore everything else, so it's all I ever end up doing.

258,"First off I would like to say that I am well aware of the fact that I have it better off than probably most people who post here. I'm not trying to be entitled or anything. But it goes to show that even if you're given everything you need by your family you can still feel this way. My case in point.

I'm 19, and I still live with either my mom and stepdad or grandparents (I go between the two places). I was raised with everything I might need, and have lived a comfortable life. However, last September, I began to feel different. That was my first semester in college, and I really didn't like the major I was in. I wanted to get out of it, and so I did. After 2nd semester I officially changed my major to something maybe I might enjoy(?). But nonetheless, I still feel terrible.

That first semester my grades were subpar, at least for my standards. But I began to feel like I was never going to go anywhere. I couldn't see my future, and I still can't. I began to lose motivation to do anything, and now I barely even have the motivation/will to live. Yesterday was the first day I told anyone in my family, my mom, that I had very little will to live.

I was forced into doing so, but yesterday I applied for several jobs. I haven't had an official job before, just miscellaneous things I did for family members and got paid some cash for. My mom said it would somehow make me better. But hell, I don't even have the motivation to do that. I feel like I can't do something everyone else can; it's not that I don't feel I'm capable, but with my mental state I'm not sure I can. And because of this, I feel absolutely pathetic. I don't feel that forcing me to do something I have no will to do is going to make me feel any better. Just look at the fact I'm living-- well I guess no one is forcing me to live, but every day I feel worse and worse, because I almost don't want to anymore.

I knew this day was going to come, but I didn't think it would be so soon. I never really imagined being this close to wanting to end everything, at least not yet. Like I said before, I couldn't see my future, and so I imagined I probably wouldn't last long after I graduate. I wondered why I'm even going to school anyways if that's how it's gonna end.

I get chastised often by my mom for being on my PC all day or playing video games, but there's a reason for this. When I'm doing these things, I at least forget about my troubles and feel happy for once. But obviously I can't live like that forever, and I don't know what else I can do when that life comes to an end.

The only few reasons I continue to feel like living is because I want to continue being with my friends, and I love to watch new TV series or videos online, and read comics. But obviously I can't do that when I'm dead. But I guess when you're dead you don't really care. But in addition to this, I have just a very minuscule shard of hope that things will get better. But I fail to see this become more likely with each day. 

People might suggest therapy, counseling, or talking to a helpline; my mom told me when school starts back up, she'll help me get a counselor on campus. But what exactly are they going to do? I doubt they could do much, if anything. Just talking isn't going to help me, so I think that things like a helpline or counselor won't really help.

When I told my mom I didn't feel much will to live anymore, I absolutely burst into tears. I can't even remember the last time I'd done that, but I was being absolutely sincere when I said it. It was so hard for me to actually get it out of my mouth, too. My mom just said it was fear, but I don't think that's totally true. What I'm scared of isn't my future, but instead is the fact I can't see myself having one. I feel like I just am not ready for life. It's not like I chose to be born, no one was. But at this point, if I had known my life was gonna come to this point, I honestly don't think I would've chosen to be. 

I just can't think of anything that can help me. Again, every day I feel worse and worse.

So, why do I even bother anymore?",suicide,"first off i would like to say that i am well aware of the fact that i have it better off than probably most people who post here i m not trying to be entitled or anything but it goes to show that even if you re given everything you need by your family you can still feel this way my case in point i m 19, and i still live with either my mom and stepdad or grandparents i go between the two places  i was raised with everything i might need, and have lived a comfortable life however, last september, i began to feel different that was my first semester in college, and i really didn t like the major i was in i wanted to get out of it, and so i did after 2nd semester i officially changed my major to something maybe i might enjoy ?  but nonetheless, i still feel terrible that first semester my grades were subpar, at least for my standards but i began to feel like i was never going to go anywhere i couldn t see my future, and i still can t i began to lose motivation to do anything, and now i barely even have the motivation will to live yesterday was the first day i told anyone in my family, my mom, that i had very little will to live i was forced into doing so, but yesterday i applied for several jobs i haven t had an official job before, just miscellaneous things i did for family members and got paid some cash for my mom said it would somehow make me better but hell, i don t even have the motivation to do that i feel like i can t do something everyone else can it s not that i don t feel i m capable, but with my mental state i m not sure i can and because of this, i feel absolutely pathetic i don t feel that forcing me to do something i have no will to do is going to make me feel any better just look at the fact i m living  well i guess no one is forcing me to live, but every day i feel worse and worse, because i almost don t want to anymore i knew this day was going to come, but i didn t think it would be so soon i never really imagined being this close to wanting to end everything, at least not yet like i said before, i couldn t see my future, and so i imagined i probably wouldn t last long after i graduate i wondered why i m even going to school anyways if that s how it s gonna end i get chastised often by my mom for being on my pc all day or playing video games, but there s a reason for this when i m doing these things, i at least forget about my troubles and feel happy for once but obviously i can t live like that forever, and i don t know what else i can do when that life comes to an end the only few reasons i continue to feel like living is because i want to continue being with my friends, and i love to watch new tv series or videos online, and read comics but obviously i can t do that when i m dead but i guess when you re dead you don t really care but in addition to this, i have just a very minuscule shard of hope that things will get better but i fail to see this become more likely with each day people might suggest therapy, counseling, or talking to a helpline my mom told me when school starts back up, she ll help me get a counselor on campus but what exactly are they going to do? i doubt they could do much, if anything just talking isn t going to help me, so i think that things like a helpline or counselor won t really help when i told my mom i didn t feel much will to live anymore, i absolutely burst into tears i can t even remember the last time i d done that, but i was being absolutely sincere when i said it it was so hard for me to actually get it out of my mouth, too my mom just said it was fear, but i don t think that s totally true what i m scared of isn t my future, but instead is the fact i can t see myself having one i feel like i just am not ready for life it s not like i chose to be born, no one was but at this point, if i had known my life was gonna come to this point, i honestly don t think i would ve chosen to be i just can t think of anything that can help me again, every day i feel worse and worse i know i said i have a few things that keep me feeling like i want to live, but eventually i think this feeling of not wanting to anymore will overcome those things so, why do i even bother anymore?"

270,"Recently my ex has come back up after breaking it off for about a year saying sorry about everything and says her grandparents (whom are racist dirtbags whom abused her in an incredible fashion that nearly sends me into a rage) said I spread her nudes and lied about evidence to split us up and get emotions overwhelm her and she believes them when she should believe me far more. Apon returning she barely talks to me, taking 10+ minutes at least 90% of the time to respond with me always being there person to start the conversation and recently my grandfather passed and it hit me pretty hard. She went to the viewing with me and we spent some time together afterwards and cheered each other up and some of our old love and chemistry showing itself when I asked for a hug in my car (I'm loving and very tactile) and it turned into a cuddle. Next came his ceremony where he got his honor gaurd and the last time we'd say goodbye before cremation and being put to rest with other soldiers and she couldn't come but we made plans the previous day that we'd spend time together and I texted her in the morning and on the way home from the ceremony with no answer, come about 8 at night she finally comes back up saying yeah let's go out but when I show up she isn't there and says she went out for fireworks. She knows I'm in extreme pain although not likely knowing that I'm toying with a knife thinking of it's blade piercing my neck in my car outside her house. She eventually tells me to go home because she has to talk to her housemates parents and we plan for tomorrow but she never responds a time even though its not even 9 yet. You can guess that tomorrow I get no response so at about 4 today I texted her accusing her off playing with me and similar stuff and her response is that she was helping her grandmother (that I was talking about earlier) plan her funeral, the day I was at my grandfather's funeral. Apparently she was doing that today as well even though she made plans with me AGAIN. The only fights we've had is because she listens to her grandparents and she lets her emotions get the best of her and this time it wasn't a misunderstanding, she accused me of not caring when she ignored me knowing I was in pain for two days and yet she never fills me in on anything doesn't talk to me or give any real effort.

272,"I think this is the worst day of my life. 
I watched all Dr K and Reckful videos about his depression and they gave me a lot of hope. He seemed fine in his latest videos, and said he was genuinely happy after lunching his game. Got the news of his suicide on 7am, just 1 hour and a half before my driving license exam, which I worked so hard to pass, and failed because I was so out of it. As they say, suicide is contagious and I'm making a big effort to not fuck it up.

I've been depressed for almost 2 years now and when I was close to taking the fast exist I went to the doctor because that seemed like the only other solution to the problem. (This was on February)
The doctor gave me an appointment with a psych 3 months later, so I waited patiently with that date in my mind to remain strong. Then corona happened and it was delayed another 3 more months, being the new date the 7th of July. Some relatives have talked very recently about their medical appointments being cancelled because of little corona infections happening again and I'm so terrified. I'm to o scared to call and ask if it has been canceled. I don't think I can do this until September alone.
I also have the university entrance exam on 6th of July (2 days left) and I haven't even started to study because I simply can't do it so I have probably already ruined my future.

Life isn't really good atm. Not like 'virus is about, society is collapsing' bad, but like 'Life is soup, I am fork' bad. It's like if God decided Jesus' death wasn't enough and decided to hand select me to die on cross #2 for post-armageddon's sins. 

Yours truly was abused and bullied up until he was about 14 to 15 years old. I was considering jumping off an apartment when I was 14. Strawberry sauce at ground floor, yknow? I didn't really want to die just yet... I decided to make 'the choice'.

If u spray a field with DEET chemicals, insects in the field either die or adapt. Apparently being the unwanted insect that nobody wanted, I chose to adapt. Every day HURTS, but I still keep going yknow? I wanted friends, grades, happiness... And I worked hard at getting them. I fought hard to get my grades straight... Tried to make myself happy...

Then I realised... Not a lot of people like me. I live on a different plane of existence, where I can't mingle or talk with people without sacrificing who I truly am. When I try to change my attitude... my approach... they still don't stay.

When you're nice, they take your stuff and leave. When you're mean, they stay a little longer! But only so they can deliver the 'last say' if you catch my drift. 
When you stop saying anything and let them come to you, they don't come! And when you try a little too hard, you're annoying. I never really felt comfortable or significantly happy at all. 

I tried everything. I didn't care if I was worth it or not, I'm going to have a happy life regardless! No one's obligated to talk to me? Well, people talked to me anyways! 'Once you get friends, you're in the matrix!' Why I would love a large helping of blue pills, Mr mental health guru.

280,"I used to be so depressed that I fucking gave up on everything contemplated suicide in the sense that I wanted to kill myself because I found no interest in life, but also didn't want to kill myself because I didn't care enough about anything. 

There is one thing I've always cared about though, weakness, and one day I took a look at myself and I realised that for multiple reasons even aside from my depression I was pathetically weak and I hated it.

300,"I don‚Äôt really have anybody to talk to and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in a bad enough place to call my therapist... so I‚Äôm here.

I‚Äôm 31 and have, for most of my life, felt like there is something wrong with me. While I am rather intelligent, I am very disorganized, struggle to focus or accomplish anything, and have no friends. Since childhood, I have tried to get help but have instead been hurt time and time again. 

At the age of 23 I feared I was transgender (despite being assigned female and wanting nothing more than to be a woman) and ended up in therapy with a psychologist who focused on gender. She understood my terror as internalized transphobia and pushed away every reason I had for not wanting to medically transition. I told her I wasn‚Äôt masculine and that thinking about starting testosterone provided me with no relief whatsoever, but therapy essentially became about me having to accept the horrible fact that I could not be a woman and would not be able to keep the body I had been blessed with. I proceeded to spend 5 years on testosterone and get a double mastectomy. It was terrible. [What I was dealing with is called transgender OCD; I never had gender dysphoria. I am a woman.]

It was only 2 years ago that I began to uncover all my memories of therapy with that woman and things came crashing down hard. I‚Äòd had to convince myself that I was too fucked up to have children and that I could not be in a romantic relationship because nothing about the reality I was living in made sense. Over those years, I couldn‚Äôt understand why I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be a woman but had to just accept it. But now here I am, having lost so many years of my life, my body and voice forever altered.

I am still completely without motivation, friends, etc. I have done so little in life and cannot even afford an apartment of my own. I have a job, but I‚Äôm doing a bad work there and do not enjoy it. On some level I have accepted that I will never have my body back, but it makes me sick every day to remember I specifically went to therapy because I didn‚Äôt want to have to transition. That therapist‚Äôs treatment of me will never make any sense to me. And to make it all worse, everything that was wrong with me as a child is still wrong with me, but it‚Äôs all much worse now that I have this extra trauma that consumes me.

I don‚Äôt think I was supposed to be born. When I was younger, I told my mom she should have aborted me (terrible, I know, but it speaks to a long held feeling). 

I regularly hope that I will die in my sleep but am coming to accept that I may have to end it myself. I don‚Äôt know how (and don‚Äôt want my roommate to have to find me) but it seems like the most rational thing to do. All I have learned from mental health treatment is that no one believes there‚Äôs anything that can be done for me. So many mental health professionals have tried to reframe my story and/or minimize various aspects of my struggle. But what I know is this: It‚Äôs not sustainable to live without connection. It feels horrible to be this smart but to have no motivation and be completely unable to accomplish anything. It hurts my heart watching everyone around me have babies and love when I know that even if somehow I found a partner, it would be cruel for me to try to be a parent. If I‚Äôm this messed up, a child of mine could really only be worse.

Anyway, maybe I‚Äôll off myself soon... but I still hope I‚Äôll get lucky and die suddenly and without pain. That would be a beautiful ending.",suicide,"i dont really have anybody to talk to and i dont think im in a bad enough place to call my therapist  so im here im 31 and have, for most of my life, felt like there is something wrong with me while i am rather intelligent, i am very disorganized, struggle to focus or accomplish anything, and have no friends since childhood, i have tried to get help but have instead been hurt time and time again at the age of 23 i feared i was transgender despite being assigned female and wanting nothing more than to be a woman and ended up in therapy with a psychologist who focused on gender she understood my terror as internalized transphobia and pushed away every reason i had for not wanting to medically transition i told her i wasnt masculine and that thinking about starting testosterone provided me with no relief whatsoever, but therapy essentially became about me having to accept the horrible fact that i could not be a woman and would not be able to keep the body i had been blessed with i proceeded to spend 5 years on testosterone and get a double mastectomy it was terrible  what i was dealing with is called transgender ocd i never had gender dysphoria i am a woman it was only 2 years ago that i began to uncover all my memories of therapy with that woman and things came crashing down hard id had to convince myself that i was too fucked up to have children and that i could not be in a romantic relationship because nothing about the reality i was living in made sense over those years, i couldnt understand why i wasnt allowed to be a woman but had to just accept it but now here i am, having lost so many years of my life, my body and voice forever altered i am still completely without motivation, friends, etc i have done so little in life and cannot even afford an apartment of my own i have a job, but im doing a bad work there and do not enjoy it on some level i have accepted that i will never have my body back, but it makes me sick every day to remember i specifically went to therapy because i didnt want to have to transition that therapists treatment of me will never make any sense to me and to make it all worse, everything that was wrong with me as a child is still wrong with me, but its all much worse now that i have this extra trauma that consumes me i dont think i was supposed to be born when i was younger, i told my mom she should have aborted me terrible, i know, but it speaks to a long held feeling  i regularly hope that i will die in my sleep but am coming to accept that i may have to end it myself i dont know how and dont want my roommate to have to find me but it seems like the most rational thing to do all i have learned from mental health treatment is that no one believes theres anything that can be done for me so many mental health professionals have tried to reframe my story and or minimize various aspects of my struggle but what i know is this its not sustainable to live without connection it feels horrible to be this smart but to have no motivation and be completely unable to accomplish anything it hurts my heart watching everyone around me have babies and love when i know that even if somehow i found a partner, it would be cruel for me to try to be a parent if im this messed up, a child of mine could really only be worse anyway, maybe ill off myself soon  but i still hope ill get lucky and die suddenly and without pain that would be a beautiful ending "

314,"Hi everyone. This might be a long post because I need to get it all out. TLDR at bottom

So I went to the ER because I was having intense suicidal thoughts. After maybe 7 hours they let me out of the ER because they said that they thought they could ‚Äútrust me‚Äù and gave me the number for an outpatient program. 

I got an appointment for intake (had to wait 4 days because they didn‚Äôt have anything earlier), but they wouldn‚Äôt let me in because I had a temperature of 98.8. They told me I could reschedule for two weeks later. I told them that I was having serious mental health issues and I couldn‚Äôt wait that long. 

After I said that, a women pulled me to a private room and asked if I was planning to kill myself. She seemed angry (like she was really busy and didn‚Äôt have time to deal with this). 

I told her that‚Äôs why I was here: that yes, I do have a plan and a method to kill myself, but that I just want to try getting help one last time before I go through with it. She then actually started yelling at me. She told me that if I couldn‚Äôt tell her I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself they would have to ‚Äúthrow me in a random psych ward. I don‚Äôt know where or even which one.‚Äù 
I know you are probably thinking I‚Äôm exaggerating that. But that is actually what she said and I could not believe she would phrase it like that. She continued to describe how terrifying the experience of being hospitalized would be for me and that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to leave. But if I could just say that I wouldn‚Äôt hurt myself I could go home instead.

I stuck to my guns and told her that I am having intense and intrusive suicidal thoughts, and that I really don‚Äôt have a yes or no answer for if I would kill myself. I told her I might be able to promise I could be safe for the next few hours, but I can‚Äôt predict how I would feel later, especially if that‚Äôs for 2 weeks. She continued to pressure me and I told her I would call 911 if it got ‚Äúreally bad‚Äù. That seemed good enough for her and she made me sign a contract that basically said someone couldn‚Äôt sue them if I killed myself. And then they told me to leave.

Later that day I got a call that said that if I got a negative covid test I could come back for an intake appointment before the two weeks were up. And that they would fit me in the same day I got the test back. I got the test. No covid. Called to tell them that and they said I wouldn‚Äôt have to wait ANOTHER 4 days for intake, even though they promised they would have me in that day. I came back after that and had a temperature of 99.2, but they just shrugged it off. I finished the intake and they told me to start the program the next day.

So far I‚Äôve only been in their partial hospitalization program for 4 days and it‚Äôs awful. 

Every day, at the end of the day, they ask us if we are going to be safe. For the first 3 days I gave them my honest answer: I don‚Äôt know. They would then have a nurse pull me into another room and do a whole routine similar to the one I mentioned earlier. They would describe how scary the hospitalization would be. They would tell me I would have to share a room with people that have mental health issues, that they would be too loud and scary for me to sleep. They basically said anything to scare me away from saying I need to be there. And I would always just tell them I would call 911 if things got worse, and they‚Äôd let me go. 

I think they shouldn‚Äôt be approaching it like this. If they make it their mission to scare people out of hospitalization, some day someone is going to go home without the help they really need and kill themselves. It‚Äôs probably already happened. 

Since my very first day, I‚Äôve also felt harassed by a male patient who have been following me, asking me out, blocking the entrance/exit so I have to talk to him, etc. I complained to the staff that it makes it hard for me to feel safe there and they said that my only option was to put up with it or leave. Not the man. Me. 

I spoke to another girl in the program about this and she said he was doing the same thing to her. I later found out this was happening to every young skinny white girl that entered the program. Someone told me it‚Äôs happened to like 8 women. They have all complained about it but the management won‚Äôt do anything. He even tried to get in her car with one of these girls. It is also on our entrance contract that you can‚Äôt ask for other patient‚Äôs numbers and he‚Äôs done that several times. I feel like under those grounds they should be able to ask him to leave or at least behave himself but they didn‚Äôt do anything.

As for my therapy group itself, I don‚Äôt know if what we are doing is therapy. I‚Äôve tried to talk about some of the issues that brought me there but our group leader just doesn‚Äôt seem interested, talks over me, and changes the topic. In the past 4 days we‚Äôve spent 12 hours talking about his favorite movies, child actors that grow up and go on coke binges, and when he thinks is the appropriate time to use the n-word. I‚Äôm not joking. He spent an hour talking about just the n-word.

The program is just giving people 9 days in php before downgrading them to the 3-days-a-week 3-hours-a-day program. So far I haven‚Äôt been able to discuss anything that brought me there and I‚Äôm already half way through my stay. Yesterday I had a panic attack about that because I realized at this rate I would be discharged without even beginning to get help. If the next 5 days were anything like the first 4, I wouldn‚Äôt have received any therapy or learned any useful skills.

I went to the front desk and asked if I could speak to someone about rearranging my care plan. They asked me who I wanted to talk to and I told them whoever is in charge. Instead, they just got a random nurse.

The nurse did the whole suicide routine with me again and then handed me off to my psychiatrist. Before I could even say why I felt like I wasn‚Äôt getting any therapy, he told me I needed to just listen to him and that I wouldn‚Äôt like what he had to say.

He asked me if diabetes is curable. I said, ‚Äúno, but it‚Äôs managed.‚Äù He asked me if AIDS is curable. ‚ÄúNo but it‚Äôs managed‚Äù

He then said ‚Äúwell then why do you expect us to cure your depression? Because we can‚Äôt.‚Äù

At this point, no one had even asked me why I was unhappy with my care. No one asked me anything. I wanted to tell him that I didn‚Äôt expect my depression to be cured, but that I do expect at least some help to even start to manage it before I leave, but he called a nurse in to take me away before I could say anything to him.

The nurse took me to another room. I told her that I feel like I‚Äôm not getting any help here. She asked if I didn‚Äôt like my group therapist. I told her yes and started to tell her that I don‚Äôt feel listened to and she cut me off (ironic). She told me that I can‚Äôt say that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting any help‚Äù and that I have to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm relating to (insert therapist name here)‚Äù. 

Which isn‚Äôt how I feel. I feel like I‚Äôm not getting any help, like I said. And I feel like I‚Äôm not being listened to, and your not listening to me.

She said ‚Äúwhat do you want? A female therapist?‚Äù

I told her ‚ÄúI guess?‚Äù because I do want a new therapist. Period. But him being a guy wasn‚Äôt the issue. Nobody had heard or wanted to hear the issue. 

I guess she just needed to check a box on a form because I was switching therapists. And if the reasons was something like the gender it would be less work because she wouldn‚Äôt have to listen to me and write it down. And that way the therapist wouldn‚Äôt get in trouble for talking about the n-word and how he thought Jodie Foster was hot in Taxi Driver for 4 days instead of doing therapy.  Gender was not the issue. The not doing any therapy part was the issue but I was so steamrolled over that nobody got to hear that.

The nurse than told me she couldn‚Äôt find anyone available and sent me to lunch, where I just sat in the parking lot for an hour feeling even more hopeless about this program than ever. When I came back the nurse said she could squeeze me into another group next week. Which I guess is good, but at this point I have lost so much faith in the rest of the program that I don‚Äôt know if I want to come back. 

At the end of the day, the group leader I‚Äôm supposed to have next week was the one who had to ask again if we would be safe. I was so emotionally exhausted that I thought if I opened my mouth I would cry. When she got to me she asked me if I wanted to pass and I nodded. She said I still needed to answer if I would be safe. I didn‚Äôt have it in me to speak so I just nodded again. She said I had to verbally say I would be safe (I guess for legal reasons). I said it and immediately burst into tears like I knew I would, in front of everyone.

I thought she might ask me if something was wrong and if I was actually safe after she let the group out. Because if you ask someone if they are going to hurt themselves and they burst into tears and can hardly choke out a few words saying they‚Äôll be ok maybe you should talk with them. But no. She just let me go anyways.

I am so hopeless about going back. My first week got me absolutely nowhere. The only thing that has changed is that I feel like no one at this hospital has any concern for my safety of any desire to hear how I feel.

I want to quit the program because I am just being made to feel uncomfortable and unimportant. I haven‚Äôt gotten any therapy while there but I‚Äôm also scared about what I would do if I‚Äôm not in a program at all.

She wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer.

Another month passes and she stops hitting me up. It got to the point where I had to completely block her on everything but she figured out a way to make a temporary number to reach out to me. After another month passes she starts hitting me up again only singing a different tune basically saying I‚Äôm a piece of shit I did nothing for her in the relationship and how I can‚Äôt forgive her for this one mistake but she can forgive me for a million. She would still try calling me at night and would randomly send me angry texts yelling at me for something she didn‚Äôt like that I did . Basically every time she tried texting me it was to remind me that I‚Äôm a coward who was bad in bed never did shit for her and had no motivation to do anything with my life.

During the relationship I struggled with depression . I was afraid to go to therapy and I hated myself and had extremely low self esteem . I had erectile dysfunction so sex gave me anxiety. My girlfriend had a very high sex drive and she always wanted to have sex and complained and made me feel bad for not wanting to enough and thought I wasn‚Äôt attracted to her . She made me feel like a loser and even yelled at me once and suggested an open relationship because I lost my erection during sex. 

She has bi-polar disorder and she would snap on me for any little thing I did. If I wasn‚Äôt getting something done quick enough, if I dropped a bag of chips going to a party. If I canceled plans. She would literally snap on me and constantly threaten to dump me. It wasn‚Äôt her fault though because she had that disorder but I couldn‚Äôt take the constant what I felt was bullying and when she would start an argument sometimes I would freak out and yell back because I didn‚Äôt know how to handle it. 

These fights would sometimes escalate into really bad screaming matches and we would both say really mean things to each other. But I swear from the bottom of my heart she would start about 95% of them because nothing I did was ever good enough for her everything was a problem to her. She picked on me and it was embarrassing. 

But we loved each other. She did a lot of things for me when she wasn‚Äôt being a jerk. She drove everywhere , tried helping me find a job when I was looking to quit my old one. Would babysit my neice ... and was a shoulder to cry on when I was going through serious problems with my depression. However that kindness could all change in an instant when she would lose it on me out of no where and I couldn‚Äôt deal with it.

Now she goes on twitter and says how I am a piece of shot for not giving her a chance , after all she did for me yet I was there for her so much during her trials and tribulations gave her so much love and affection. She tells me I‚Äôm a loser with no motivation never drove couldn‚Äôt fuck and didn‚Äôt deserve her even though I helped her so much during a really difficult time in her life and she would tell me constantly I deserve better and that she may have ended her life if it weren‚Äôt for me and some  of her friends .

Now I just can‚Äôt deal anymore with her bitching at me telling me I‚Äôm a loser. My sexual problems my constant hatred of myself . I‚Äôll never be ok, I‚Äôll never find the right woman and I don‚Äôt deserve too maybe I am a loser seriously. It‚Äôs probly time.

350,"# Let me tell you about my family a little before we get started

My great-grandfather was very rich that my family literally owned a small town in Izmir until they sold most of it because they are spending way too much money for their own \*entertainment\*.

My aunt is married to a millionaire (maybe billionaire? idk his net worth) business man who owns an international construction company along with many other smaller companies in different industries, his company primarily works for middle-eastern governments including Turkey's.

That same aunt apparently (I was told by my father) has connections to *extraordinarily* important and rich government officials also. (won't get into details for obvious reasons)

My family also has connections to politicians from both major parties in this country, one of which helped me get appointment from one of the best doctors for my OCD treatment (of course we couldn't afford it after like 3 sessions and I'm currently not getting medical help) after months of seeing a doctor who clearly does not know what he is doing.

All my cousins are well-educated and living in first-world countries such as Canada, United States and some EU countries.

# About me

I'm a 20 years old male from a very poor part of Turkey, a shitty middle-east country.

I grew up poor, didn't get any proper education (public schools in this country is, well, you get the picture) and learned everything I know by myself without any help.

I currently live with my mom and dad at a poor and dangerous neighborhood (people would literally stab you for looking at their eyes here!), needless to say we have no money and I'm living in pretty bad conditions.

For the last 6 years I have only had one single goal in my life: moving to a good country with my mom, preferably Canada. I'm rapidly losing my hopes of moving as our financial situation only gets worse and worse.

No one in my family cares about me, no one ever did. They almost deny my existence as they wouldn't even recognize me if I was standing right next to them in a bus stop. I was always a disappointment to them ever since I was born, all because my grandmother didn't want my father to marry my mom.

I never had any friends except one from middle school (whom I lost contact with 8 years ago). I never lived my childhood and teenage years and I'm likely to sit my 20s in this old, cheap chair looking at this computer screen. In the last 7 years of my live I learned programming and I made various different websites/apps/games with hopes I'd earn enough money to actually be able to live. No, all I got sums to around $5K. I can't even use my programming skills for my own projects anymore as I will no longer be able to afford paying for server costs due to Turkish Lira rapidly losing value against the United States Dollar and our only income is in TL.

I don't believe in any god or a supernatural entity, death is like time travel to me, I believe that once I'm dead trillions of years might pass and to me it wouldn't be anything. I would stay as nothing until whatever is me becomes something conscious again.

I have planned to end my life in many ways over the last decade, countless times. I planned every single detail very carefully to make sure nothing goes wrong. I even planned to leave a video note behind me for those who left me to rot in this shithole like they would even bother watching it.

All these scenarios and I can't possibly think of one single future where I survive after my mom and dog dies. I would kill myself without even thinking twice.

371,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm a junkie, 23 years old with no friend, no job, no car, living alone in a foreign country with my grandma‚Äôs money.‚Äù

When I was born, my mom passed aways and my dad left me with my aunt and grandma. Grandma did a fine job taking care of me. However, my aunt would always hurt me, if not with her hands then her words. One time she locked me in the closet for days with out food or water, yelling ‚Äúeven your dad doesn‚Äôt want you, you shouldn‚Äôt be born.‚Äù It hurts so much but I get used to it.

As expected, growing up in abusive household took a toll on me. I became a troubled student as soon as I joined middle school. It started with little thing like fighting, smoking cigarettes, stealing other student‚Äôs stuff, one time I punched a teacher.

They had enough of me, my grandma and my aunt couldn‚Äôt handle me anymore so they sent me back to live with my dad. Btw, my dad started a new family so now I have step mom and step sister. 

After moving to new city, new school, new family, I felt lost. They all made me felt like I don‚Äôt belong in that family, that I‚Äôll aways be a mistake, that I don‚Äôt belong anywhere. I had no one to talk to, no one to ask for help, so I hid my problems, buried it deep down so it doesn‚Äôt hurt. 

I wanted to be recognized by my dad so I did everything to make him proud. I wasn‚Äôt bad at high school, as I always landed in top 5 of my grade. But that wasn‚Äôt enough. He never said he loves me or proud of me, hell he never act like it to. 

I started playing instruments, guitar, and piano. I joined the competitive martial art group and even got to the semi final match of my city. I ran for a school presidency, I got scholarship for top 4 university in Thailand, doing all that hoping to that he‚Äôd finally approve me as his son. Nope, ain‚Äôt got time for non of that. 

Ok I get it, I was a mistake. It doesn‚Äôt matter how hard I tried, he‚Äôll never be proud of me, so I gave up.

This happens when I was 18. I tried to kill myself.

My roommate came back and see me on the floor, throwing up, shaking, stuffs coming out of my mouth. I‚Äôd been hospitalized and diagnosed with clinical depression, panic attack, bipolar so they prescribed me bars and some other antidepressants. I stayed in hospital alone for days, hoping someone in my family would at least call or come to visit me, none. 

This finally hits me that I‚Äôm and I‚Äôll always be a mistake. So I ran aways, I came to the United States as college student. 

After a few months, instead of study hard working for better future, I started taking more prescribed pills, smoking weed, doing stuffs I‚Äôd never imaged before. Gambling aways my time and money. It felt good I‚Äôll tell you that, there‚Äôs not a thing in world you have to care when you get that dopamine ride. 

But what come up must goes down. After 2 years alone in US I tried to end it all again but I‚Äôm a coward and I couldn‚Äôt do it. I just couldn‚Äôt jump. I called suicide prevention line and they took me in for a few days.

After I was discharged I went back to be an addict full time. Gambling, smoking dope, popping pills.

Days turn to months, months turn to years and I stuck in the same loop. Waking up, get high, go to sleep. Repeat it over and over again. I don‚Äôt eat anymore because if I buy food then I don‚Äôt have money to pay for rent. 

It been 5 years now since I left the place I called ‚Äòhome‚Äô and I‚Äôm still the same person when I left, a loner, a failure, a mistake, plus hella addictions. 

I want it all to end. I feel shameful and guilt every time I look in a mirror, I hate seeing myself.

Everyone said get a job and life will be better... but who‚Äôd want a broken person like me? I can‚Äôt even work legally here.

I‚Äôve been sober for 4 months now. Everyday is a living hell for me. I have no purpose, no more self esteem.

I‚Äôm 23 and I‚Äôve tried to kill myself twice.
I just hope next time will be the last.

372,Yet too bad I won't even enjoy it.,suicide,yet too bad i won t even enjoy it 
373,"I've already written this here about a week ago in the comments of my other post, but I want to write it again.

Sometimes when I write about my family situation, I word it in a way that makes other people think that I live with an abussive mother. And this makes me feel very bad, because this is just not true. My mom actually has kicked my abussive step-dad from our house 6 years ago, which helped me a lot. And she have spent a lot of time and money trying to provide me a proper education and professional mental help. But this just didn't worked.

I've attempted to study in the university 3 times, but every time I failed in the first half-year because of my mental health getting worse and worse. Medical treatment had no positive effect at all. And I had very negative experience with so many therapists, I just don't trust any of them anymore.

My mom is not abussive - I'm actually the one who is abusing her. I often loudly yell at her for stupid reasons, because my sick brain precepts a lot of harmless things as an acts of hostility, and making me act very defensive. And even thought I always apologize to her about an hour after, this really poisons my mom's life (because, obviously, just  saying sorry and hugging will to heal the damage that have already been done).

She often tells me that one day I will drive her to stroke, and that she really wants to finally escape from me, and live with her BF in another county (and she already  has a serious plans to do this, but Coronavirus messed everything up). And this is really understandable - I yell at her very loud and often  also prefer all sorts of mental gymnastics to accuse her at even more insane things. And this hurts her so much, that she tells me that if I will continue she will call an ambulance that will drove me to a mental asylum (even though this is abviously not true - she loves me, and will never do that to me).

Don't think that she wants to leave me starving though (like I paranoidly say to her  sometimes) - she says that she will still financially support me, even from another country. But she really wants me to be able to live alone, without her constant help. I say to her that I can't work, but I think it's a lie (more to myself, that to her). Like she says, I still have my hands and legs, and don't have anything serious (like schizophrenia), so I can have at least a basic job to sustain my life - I'm just too lazy to do so, while other people with my exact issues can live alone fine.

Basically, I'm leeching on my mom. And the fact that with all of this I'm also (most likely intentionaly) wording my posts they way that make **her** look like and abuser, really makes me hate myself.",suicide,"i ve already written this here about a week ago in the comments of my other post, but i want to write it again sometimes when i write about my family situation, i word it in a way that makes other people think that i live with an abussive mother and this makes me feel very bad, because this is just not true my mom actually has kicked my abussive step dad from our house 6 years ago, which helped me a lot and she have spent a lot of time and money trying to provide me a proper education and professional mental help but this just didn t worked i ve attempted to study in the university 3 times, but every time i failed in the first half year because of my mental health getting worse and worse medical treatment had no positive effect at all and i had very negative experience with so many therapists, i just don t trust any of them anymore my mom is not abussive  i m actually the one who is abusing her i often loudly yell at her for stupid reasons, because my sick brain precepts a lot of harmless things as an acts of hostility, and making me act very defensive and even thought i always apologize to her about an hour after, this really poisons my mom s life because, obviously, just saying sorry and hugging will to heal the damage that have already been done she often tells me that one day i will drive her to stroke, and that she really wants to finally escape from me, and live with her bf in another county and she already has a serious plans to do this, but coronavirus messed everything up  and this is really understandable  i yell at her very loud and often also prefer all sorts of mental gymnastics to accuse her at even more insane things and this hurts her so much, that she tells me that if i will continue she will call an ambulance that will drove me to a mental asylum even though this is abviously not true  she loves me, and will never do that to me don t think that she wants to leave me starving though like i paranoidly say to her sometimes  she says that she will still financially support me, even from another country but she really wants me to be able to live alone, without her constant help i say to her that i can t work, but i think it s a lie more to myself, that to her  like she says, i still have my hands and legs, and don t have anything serious like schizophrenia , so i can have at least a basic job to sustain my life  i m just too lazy to do so, while other people with my exact issues can live alone fine basically, i m leeching on my mom and the fact that with all of this i m also most likely intentionaly wording my posts they way that make  her  look like and abuser, really makes me hate myself "
374,"No one truly cares about you until you're gone... This has been a universal truth since the beginning of man. No one wants to acknowledge your mental illness or need for support even though you're clearly signaling for help, instead most will ridicule you and treat your call for help as a cry for attention because they lack the empathy and intelligence to understand and perceive the world as through your perspective.

377,"Hi, sorry I don‚Äôt really know how to start.

In September of 2017, I was called into school to discuss with a counsellor why my attendance had been worsening, my mother had to come with me too. We arrived at the school, went through the office and into a room with a counsellor.

We sat down, and he was asking me and my
Mother questions, I don‚Äôt remember what they were but seeing as the meeting was being held to discuss attendance, I‚Äôm sure you can imagine what he wanted to talk about. All I really remember about the meeting is when he asked, ‚Äúare you willing to go into school now?‚Äù, because this was at about 10am on a school day. I replied with ‚Äúno, could I start fresh tomorrow?‚Äù. He said ‚Äúok, make sure you turn up though.‚Äù But in that moment I was completely aware that that was it for me.

In that moment, when I said no. That was it, I didn‚Äôt come in the next day, or the day after, I never went in again. Having being told all my life by my teachers that I had great potential, coming to realise that I had completely failed academically, because of my stupid fucking mental health. It haunts me everyday that moment.

Since then, I‚Äôve bounced around various mental health services who have tried to help me, all of which require me to leave my home. Which I can‚Äôt do anymore. I‚Äôm petrified of strangers, god forbid one laughs within a one mile radius of me, I‚Äôll think that they‚Äôre laughing at me cause I look like a disgusting goblin.

As I said all the help I was offered was dependant on me leaving my home, which I was unable to do, and I still am unable to do. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt leave my home, my mind is foggy, I‚Äôm forgetting how to feel anything other than despair. I watch everyone I went to school with surpass me in every way imaginable. I‚Äôm stuck. I don‚Äôt want to live. I have no one to talk too, my mother is too old fashioned to understand what I feel. 

Everyday I wake up, go to my computer and sit at it everyday. I‚Äôm a leech, completely fucking useless, a complete and utter burden on everyone, even on my self. Why the fuck did I have to be born, why couldn‚Äôt someone more appreciative be born in my place. 

These are my current diagnoses, figured they should be included.

.Social Anxiety Disorder
.Major Depressive Disorder
.Borderline Personality Disorder

I don't even like weed!!!

So I jusf wandered around the neighborhood and found an open bar. Grabbed a couple of beer's and head out.

408,"Someone in my life once told me that talking about my suicidal thoughts meant I would never do it. That I wasn't serious. That I just wanted to put my problems on other people. That's not true. 

I've talked about them recently because it's what they say I should do. They say to let people in. To talk. I've made a plan and I have to get it out of my head so I'm posting here.

This time though, I've made a plan. I have a month to write my letters, get my financial things in order, and cover any loose ends. I've given myself a month to try and give the people in my life some good memories of me. I also want more good memories of them to carry with me. Once the month is up I plan to commit suicide. 

I want to be away from home so my family doesn't associate loved places with my death. I know how and I know it'll work. It would have last time had I not been found. I feel like this huge weight has lifted from me. I'm more at ease than I've been in years knowing I have a plan.

409,"I'm not feeling too good today, these last few weeks haven't been the best and it's all starting to hit at once.

414,"I need to tell this story. Because nothing has gone right at any stage and I've gone from feeling on top of things to consistently wanting to throw myself off my balcony in the space of a week. I'm a 31 year old male living by myself in a 1 bedroom apartment in the Melbourne metro area. I work as a team leader for a company, currently working from home due to the pandemic. I'm single. I have a condition called acromegaly which requires daily treatment and incurs a lot of medical costs.

Over the last 4 months my workplace has been cutting costs and shedding any jobs they can in order to counter the lack of referrals we've had since la corona kicked off. In this timeframe my workload has tripled. I've gone from looking after a single team of 6 people to managing 20 people across 2 teams and having to liaise with key stake holders far more than I am comfortable. This sort of work is not in my wheelhouse and I've not been comfortable with it. Not that I've had a choice.

This Monday just gone, I had a meeting with my new boss (reporting to her for around 8 days at this stage) and she has casually lumped me with a handful of tasks that I don't know how to get down while juggling my existing workload and meeting all the existing targets I have and I...broke down. I lost my cool, on the verge of tears talking about how this workload is draining me and how this isn't the sort of work I signed up to do. Then it was over and I moved on to my next meeting and continued with my work, miserable but able to continue working. I then get a Zoom call from my boss again and a rep from HR. I attempt to play it off, giving her an update on everything that I've got done in the 45 minutes since we last spoke to no avail.

They advise me to take the rest of the day and Tuesday off because they're ""worried about me"". I attempt to fight this because a day and a half off isn't going to help me when my workload will be waiting for me when I get back and I really don't want to lose time. I'm told I have no choice as my boss's boss is now involved and they ""want to make sure I'm alright"". I'm not happy about this but again I have no choice. So I log off and...try to do anything else. Unsuccessfully. I went from being mildly anxious and stressed to full blown depressed in the space of 10 minutes. I spent most of that day and a half sleeping.

Wednesday rolls around and I log on to start my day. I get a call from the HR rep who tells me that I can't come back to work until I've got medical clearance to return. She tells me that our EAP (employee assistance program) or a GP can provide this document. I'm not even remotely happy about this so I channel my inner Karen and email my boss's boss and the HR manager with my concerns in a well written request to have this overturned. It was denied...6 hours later. Boss's boss says that they'll keep my on paid leave until Monday but I need a letter clearing me to return before I can come back. In this time frame I have contacted EAP (twice) and contacted my GP, neither of whom are able to write this letter. My GP gives me a psych referral claiming that they might be able to write said letter. I start looking for psych appointments at short term notice and decide to try my hand with EAP again.

The person I get through to indicates initially that they may be able to help. I talk with them for 20 minutes before bringing up the letter again, to which they advise that they can't provide me something like this. I'm frustrated here, yell something alone the lines of ""What's the point of any of this then?!"" and hang up. After this I'm feeling lost. I go to the local shopping centre to visit the pharmacy to get some prescriptions filled. I get food on the way home. I get home, sit down and I'm about to eat my food when I get a call on the intercomm. 

It's the Police. EAP called in a welfare check. I politely tell them to piss off and indicate I wont let them into the building. This happened once before (an ex-girlfriend being a possessive pain in the ass) during which when I opened the door a crack to tell them to go away, the shoved their foot in the door and shoved a gas dispenser in my face looking to subdue me. They then forced their way inside. I'm not letting that happen again. 15 minutes after I've told them to go away, they knock on the door having got inside the apartment complex. I again tell them to piss off and refuse to open the door. After some back and forth they offer to have an emergency psych consultant call me to chat. I agree to this hoping this might help me get my letter. No call ever came through. This is still Wednesday.

Thursday rolls around and with no call from whoever the Police said would call, I'm left still looking for a psych appointment. I'm about to give up when at around 2pm, I land a telephone appointment for 7pm that day. I book it in and I finally relax a little hoping that this will finally get me the documentation needed by Monday. 7pm rolls around. Then 7:15. I call the reception for this place, voicemail. I send an email. Nothing. 8pm. I give up. Disheartened once again. Deflated. Dejected. Helpless. I got to sleep.

Friday. 8:30am. I get a call from the receptionist for the company that stood me up. They offer to rebook me for 1pm. I'm elated. Energetic again. I accept. I get a follow up call from the psych apologising for the previous night blaming a scheduling issue. 1pm appointment confirmed. I get up, slightly revitalised. I eat some food and have a shower, suddenly aware it's been a while since I'd done both. I relax and enjoy myself for a few hours until the appointment.

1pm. Got the Zoom invite and jump on a call with the psych. Explain the circumstances and what I need assuming she will then ask me some questions to get an idea about me. I volunteer as much information as I can and explain the outburst as a result of my workload and how work is concerned for my safety. She...doesn't believe that's why work requested said document. She talks about how my manager must have felt threatened by my actions and talked about how I can't go around threatening people in the workplace. She then talks about how my appearance itself must be very threatening and how I should do something to mitigate that by trimming my beard and tying my hair back (I'm a big guy with wild curly hair and a quarantine beard currently). I follow along with what she's saying and try to point out that the outburst was directed inward at myself rather than outward at another person. She doesn't believe me. I express my concerns about the fact that she's not really listening to what I'm saying and rather just pushing what she believes happened. She then says that if we can't communicate then we should end the session now, tells me she wont be charging me and moves to wrap things up. This was at the tail end of a half hour conversation. I try to talk her down citing that I'm not saying these things to disagree with her but because it's important to have a meaningful back and forth and that I was worried she was getting the wrong idea about me. She doesn't care. The session ends. I break down in tears. I go to sleep.

Friday evening. 9:30pm. I don't know what to do. I don't know where I stand or if I'll even have a job on Monday. I can't believe this cancerous week I've had and I'm terrified of what the future holds. With my health issues, I can't afford to be unemployed right now. This genuinely scares me. There's no way I'll be able to enjoy my weekend. I can't eat, I can't enjoy myself. I'm convinced work has done this because they want to get rid of me. I'm so tired of this. I'm tired of everything.

 and hang up after this i m feeling lost i go to the local shopping centre to visit the pharmacy to get some prescriptions filled i get food on the way home i get home, sit down and i m about to eat my food when i get a call on the intercomm it s the police eap called in a welfare check i politely tell them to piss off and indicate i wont let them into the building this happened once before an ex girlfriend being a possessive pain in the ass during which when i opened the door a crack to tell them to go away, the shoved their foot in the door and shoved a gas dispenser in my face looking to subdue me they then forced their way inside i m not letting that happen again 15 minutes after i ve told them to go away, they knock on the door having got inside the apartment complex i again tell them to piss off and refuse to open the door after some back and forth they offer to have an emergency psych consultant call me to chat i agree to this hoping this might help me get my letter no call ever came through this is still wednesday thursday rolls around and with no call from whoever the police said would call, i m left still looking for a psych appointment i m about to give up when at around 2pm, i land a telephone appointment for 7pm that day i book it in and i finally relax a little hoping that this will finally get me the documentation needed by monday 7pm rolls around then 7 15 i call the reception for this place, voicemail i send an email nothing 8pm i give up disheartened once again deflated dejected helpless i got to sleep friday 8 30am i get a call from the receptionist for the company that stood me up they offer to rebook me for 1pm i m elated energetic again i accept i get a follow up call from the psych apologising for the previous night blaming a scheduling issue 1pm appointment confirmed i get up, slightly revitalised i eat some food and have a shower, suddenly aware it s been a while since i d done both i relax and enjoy myself for a few hours until the appointment 1pm got the zoom invite and jump on a call with the psych explain the circumstances and what i need assuming she will then ask me some questions to get an idea about me i volunteer as much information as i can and explain the outburst as a result of my workload and how work is concerned for my safety she  doesn t believe that s why work requested said document she talks about how my manager must have felt threatened by my actions and talked about how i can t go around threatening people in the workplace she then talks about how my appearance itself must be very threatening and how i should do something to mitigate that by trimming my beard and tying my hair back i m a big guy with wild curly hair and a quarantine beard currently  i follow along with what she s saying and try to point out that the outburst was directed inward at myself rather than outward at another person she doesn t believe me i express my concerns about the fact that she s not really listening to what i m saying and rather just pushing what she believes happened she then says that if we can t communicate then we should end the session now, tells me she wont be charging me and moves to wrap things up this was at the tail end of a half hour conversation i try to talk her down citing that i m not saying these things to disagree with her but because it s important to have a meaningful back and forth and that i was worried she was getting the wrong idea about me she doesn t care the session ends i break down in tears i go to sleep friday evening 9 30pm i don t know what to do i don t know where i stand or if i ll even have a job on monday i can t believe this cancerous week i ve had and i m terrified of what the future holds with my health issues, i can t afford to be unemployed right now this genuinely scares me there s no way i ll be able to enjoy my weekend i can t eat, i can t enjoy myself i m convinced work has done this because they want to get rid of me i m so tired of this i m tired of everything i don t want to keep on struggling against the world when the world is clearly telling me i m not meant to exist i m not meant to have a life or stability i don t know why any of this happened none of this is fair and i m mortally tired i genuinely want to jump to be free of all of this pressure to be free of everything this life has been cruel, unjust and unkind to me "

we set up a time for him to call the next day and check in, but he said he wouldn't be concerned if I didn't answer. that hurt. I felt like he didn't believe my situation was serious. that or he just didn't care.

before I left, he asked if I still wanted to kill myself. I told him yes. and he just sent me on my way.

he called the next day, and we set up a time for one last check in the following day. but no one ever called. and honestly, that hurt.

I am unemployed, and have no skills employers find desirable(I have been applying to many places for the past three years, trying different tips and tricks I found on the internet on how to make applications more likely to catch an employers eye, listing only relevant past jobs and volunteer work I did in highschool, and am still lucky to just get an email to let me know they don't want me).

Obviously I'm at fault and am a useless b!tch, I must have not walked them and lied about it. That's just one example.

He makes me feel like such dead weight, I feel guilty for even eating. So I don't. Why waste precious food that he spent his hard-earned money for on me? I'm already wasting his money by just using the toilet and showering, water bills are a thing.

And God forbid I try to tell him how I'm feeling. Somehow he'll turn it on me, saying I'm crazy, that I'm being disrespectful and ungrateful, that I shouldn't complain because he's keeping a roof over my head.

If I'm this much trouble, maybe everyone would be better off if I just died. No one would have to deal with me again. No one would ever have to carry me again and be disappointed in me again.

440,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on why I feel this way


Basically, I am a 24 year old female and ever since I was around 12, I've continually for different lengths of time went through periods where all I can think of is commiting suicide. 

Half the time, I do really want to die. I just think my life is terrible and there is no hope for me. I feel like life almost becomes too much, things affects me so much and just the thought of future life challenges just makes me want to end it. Almost as if I'm too weak. It is almost a comforting thought knowing it is an option. 

It is a constant feeling of how could I do it? where can I do it? when? I also think alot about how it'd affect people. When people hurt me, I go to that dark place and think well this would show you how much you've hurt me. Terribly selfish I know. 

The other half of the time I just think about it but I'm fairly certain I'd never do it. 

The times in my life when I don't think about suicide are when I have alot going on. When I have a busy/happy life. When I got to the age of 12 my parents started moving me around alot, so I've spent alot of my life alone. So I think this is what started it. I'm very close to my mum as she has been my best friend all my life but she is generally quite a sad and depressed person so I wonder if that has affected me to..

But even though I'm an adult now, it's still there. It feels like a dark cloud that's always there, waiting. Up until the start of lockdown, I hadn't had those feelings for around 2 years (maybe the occasionaly one but it was the happiest i'd ever been). So yeah, it's back.. how can I fix this? How can I fix myself?

442,"So a little forward, I'm a 19 year old male college student and i've  been depressed for the past 7 years.  I've never attempted suicide, though I think about it multiple times a day, and have never physically harmed myself.  But I do often fantasize about killing myself and for the better part of the past 7 years have seen ending my life as a net positive.  Anyway, I decided to write a hypothetical suicide letter just as a way to vent and get out my underlying frustrations with life and organize my thoughts on why I'm truly so miserable.  I'd appreciate anyone's insight into the letter.   
PS:  I talk about a lot of my fundamental beliefs here and don't really justify my reasoning for them just because I'm not trying to convince anyone of them, I'm just explaining them so  people get why I'm so upset.  

Anyway here it is:

I believe every human since the dawn of civilization has been entitled to a peaceful life full of all the resources which can be given to them as long as it doesn't detract from another's life.  In exchange, for this gift, all that a human need give is the bare minimum of what is necessary for the system which they benefit from to remain stable and able to continue its duties for the forceable future.  This isn't the case, and never will be.  That is acceptable.  What isn't acceptable is that I, and the overwhelming majority of all humans to ever exist, have been robbed of most of the potential joy which would've otherwise been found within their lives.  Since the dawn of civilization itself, social hierarchies have forced the majority of a population to sacrifice resources which, in a just world, they should be entitled to, in order to give a small minority ridiculous amounts of wealth.  This has always been the case but what is so disheartening about it is that this has continued to happen throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.  The majority of the western world has, in this time, been educated enough to understand the unjust arrangements they have found themselves in and yet little progress has occurred.  Whenever the people become upset enough to finally rise up and and rearrange the established social-order, they are thrown a bone by the elites in order to stave off starvation for a couple more decades.  Whenever this hasn't been the case, in nations such as the Russian Empire, or China, the successor states have also failed to create an egalitarian society full of a sufficient amount of prosperity for the general population.  This has led me to the conclusion that humanity at large will forever be in the servitude to horrible tyrants.  Rather than conform to this structure, and live a meaningless and unfulfilling life of Consumerism as a wage-slave to the elite, I will be ending my life.  

Make no mistake, this is indeed a spiteful action directed toward elites who will likely never know I died or why and who are even less likely to even care.  Regardless, I'd prefer to give my life in service of a minuscule ""fuck you"" to the established political and economic elite of the United States rather than conform and live a life of limited happiness in which the vast majority of my time will be spent laboring away making the very men and women rich who are, in their greed, stopping me and the rest of humanity from being able to spend our limited lives in a way we individually see fit.",suicide,"so a little forward, i m a 19 year old male college student and i ve been depressed for the past 7 years  i ve never attempted suicide, though i think about it multiple times a day, and have never physically harmed myself  but i do often fantasize about killing myself and for the better part of the past 7 years have seen ending my life as a net positive  anyway, i decided to write a hypothetical suicide letter just as a way to vent and get out my underlying frustrations with life and organize my thoughts on why i m truly so miserable  i d appreciate anyone s insight into the letter  ps  i talk about a lot of my fundamental beliefs here and don t really justify my reasoning for them just because i m not trying to convince anyone of them, i m just explaining them so people get why i m so upset  anyway here it is i believe every human since the dawn of civilization has been entitled to a peaceful life full of all the resources which can be given to them as long as it doesn t detract from another s life  in exchange, for this gift, all that a human need give is the bare minimum of what is necessary for the system which they benefit from to remain stable and able to continue its duties for the forceable future  this isn t the case, and never will be  that is acceptable  what isn t acceptable is that i, and the overwhelming majority of all humans to ever exist, have been robbed of most of the potential joy which would ve otherwise been found within their lives  since the dawn of civilization itself, social hierarchies have forced the majority of a population to sacrifice resources which, in a just world, they should be entitled to, in order to give a small minority ridiculous amounts of wealth  this has always been the case but what is so disheartening about it is that this has continued to happen throughout the 20th and 21st centuries  the majority of the western world has, in this time, been educated enough to understand the unjust arrangements they have found themselves in and yet little progress has occurred  whenever the people become upset enough to finally rise up and and rearrange the established social order, they are thrown a bone by the elites in order to stave off starvation for a couple more decades  whenever this hasn t been the case, in nations such as the russian empire, or china, the successor states have also failed to create an egalitarian society full of a sufficient amount of prosperity for the general population  this has led me to the conclusion that humanity at large will forever be in the servitude to horrible tyrants  rather than conform to this structure, and live a meaningless and unfulfilling life of consumerism as a wage slave to the elite, i will be ending my life  make no mistake, this is indeed a spiteful action directed toward elites who will likely never know i died or why and who are even less likely to even care  regardless, i d prefer to give my life in service of a minuscule fuck you to the established political and economic elite of the united states rather than conform and live a life of limited happiness in which the vast majority of my time will be spent laboring away making the very men and women rich who are, in their greed, stopping me and the rest of humanity from being able to spend our limited lives in a way we individually see fit "

448,"A short essay on how I'm a failure and all around piece of shit¬†


I never thought I had much of a purpose in life, and I'm okay with that fact, but I am sure that if I did have a purpose this isn't it and i am the only one to blame¬†

For starters I have always been a shitty person, not from the lack of trying to be better, just never being as good as I can be. My family is forced to love me because y'know being family and stuff, and I feel so fucking sorry for my friends cause they choose to hang around this waste of space.¬†


I had one friend thought I felt the most comfortable around, I could just be myself. I would do anything for him, and always wanted to be there to support him.

He killed himself

What kind of fucking pathetic asshole let's this happen. it's not like I didn't know what was going on, I just choose not to take action. I failed him on so many levels and I'll be eternally sorry to you max.but I do not deserve your forgiveness. The pain I feel now that your gone is more than I can bare, but it is pain I know I deserve to have.


My failure ways continue after hes gone though, even though my friends foolishly put there trust in me, I still care about them and want to help them through this as much as possible but I cant. I can't stop there pain or make them hurt less. Every word I speak pushes them further and further back. I want to help. Im doing the opposite. Knowing your hurting the people you love most is worse then any other I have ever felt. I failed max. And I continue to fail my other friends.¬†

Everything would be better if I killed myself, maybe not right away but people would get over me, and fuck it would be so much easier for me.

461,"I don't know why I'm reaching out now of all times, but it seems appropriate, since I just told my family how much I disregard the value of life after getting a R1000 speeding fine. They couldn't understand why I would put myself in danger like that. The truth is, I take stupid risks all the time, because it excites me that there a chance of me dying by ""accident"". I don't know why the notion of death is so attractive, but I can't seem to escape it. 

They tell me how the crime in South Africa is terrible and that they don't feel safe anywhere and they don't understand how little I care. I just don't value myself enough to care. I don't value life in general I guess, because when you've been craving to die for so long, it causes you to not care about the living (well this is the case for me at least). 

More-so, they try to make me feel guilty about it, saying: ""suicide is selfish"". However, I feel that, what is more selfish is to make someone feel obliged to stay alive for the sole reason of sparing your pain. Hence, I won't hear any of that BS. My mother had three kids. WTF are the other two, if not backups? I mean, in the 1800s, life expectancy was between 38 and 44 years. Nowadays, hospitals have become so good, that you probably have a higher chance of dying from a refrigerator falling in you than dying at childbirth. I mean, I was born with double pneumonia or something along those lines. That had to be a sort of sign: some people are just not meant to be. But no, I was saved through bloody medical technology. 

I see so many people that are so content and naive about so many things: ""The future will sort itself out""; ""Population growth is fine""; ""Climate change isn't real"". I wish I was that fucking stupid. Then I'd be able to treat any harsh situation with indifference and not care about the future at all. 

I did had a girlfriend for a few months and she has been the greatest thing for me. I never knew what I was to anyone and I never had a real reason to be. I mean family are born with you. They're stuck with you, but for someone to choose you is a lot more special I guess. And I don't think it's healthy to draw all ones self-worth from one person, but no other way makes sense to me. I can't find a source to find intrinsic self-worth anywhere. 

Also I've seen that this kind of through process is common amongst the INFP personality type. Many seem to say: ""I'm very creative, but at the same time I always want to kill myself""; lovely compromise. Anyway, do you guys (and girls) have any tips? I mean, what are the things that make you not feel worthless? And what is your reason to be?
